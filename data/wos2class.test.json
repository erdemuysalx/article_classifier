{"abstract":{"6416":"Two purified fractions were prepared by the sequential purification of litchi pulp polysaccharide (LP) through ion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. Their preliminary structures and immunomodulatory activities were investigated. The two fractions, LPI and LPII, were homogeneous heteropolysaccharides mainly composed of arabinose, glucose, galactose and mannose with average molecular weights (M(w)s) of 213 and 36.9 kDa, respectively. LPII was quite different from LPI; it had a triple helix structure and a much higher content of neutral sugar, uronic acid, arabinose, glucose and mannose (p < 0.05). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data showed LPI contained alpha-D-Galp and alpha-L-Araf-(1 -> and LPII was consisted of -> 3)-beta-L-Araf-(1 ->, beta-(1 -> 2)-Galp and -> 4)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 ->. The results from in vitro immunomodulatory activities indicate that LPII was a better stimulator than LPI on splenocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity from 100-300 mu g mL(-1) (p < 0.05). LPII exhibited stronger immunostimulatory activity, which may be attributed to its unique structure.","5432":"Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite with a novel three-layer-3D-structure, which consists of an external polypyrrole coating layer, an intermediate sulfur filling layer, and an internal polypyrrole split-half-tube conducting matrix layer, has been synthesized by the oxidative chemical polymerization method and chemical precipitation method in this article. Due to this unique three-layer-structure, the discharge specific capacity of Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite cathode retained at 554 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which represents 68.8% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. In comparison, the Sulfur Polypyrrole composite cathode, with the same components as Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, but without the three-layer-structure, has the discharge specific capacity of 370 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is 32.3% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the unique three-layer-structure plays an essential role in improving the performance of the Lithium\/Sulfur batteries. Moreover, the effects of LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte on coulombic efficiency are discussed to further confirm the containment function of the external layer of polypyrrole in the Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, which is the evidence that the external layer of polypyrrole can effectively confine the dissolved polysulfides.

However, such integration is challenging, as these proteins have to be \"wired\" to electrodes and oriented to maximize light capture and electron transfer all while maintaining long-term activity. In this work we present a durable and unique solution to the challenges of stabilization and wiring of photosynthetic membrane proteins on electrodes. A block copolymer, poly(butadiene)(12)-poly(ethylene oxide)(8) (PB12-PEO8), that mimics the bilayer assembly of lipids was used to stabilize photosystem I (PSI) in a near-native hydrophobic environment. At high protein concentrations, large, highly packed planar membranes (similar to 4 nm thick) were formed, which allowed high surface loading of protein at the electrode interface. To \"wire\" these membranes with metal electrodes, a conductive block copolymer bilayer based on the same PB12-PEO8 but with intercalated conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) was used. This photo-active conductive layer was used to conduct electrons while maintaining a stabilizing cell membrane-like hydrated environment at the protein-metal interface. Photocurrents approaching 35.0 +\/- 3.5 mA cm(-2) were generated upon illumination of these assembled devices with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), among the highest reported so far for such systems on a per protein basis. This is the first application of membrane proteins completely stabilized in and on a block copolymer support for an energy-relevant electrochemical device and may represent the highest photocurrent generation per protein.","5850":"Spheres, tubes, and planar-shaped nanomaterials as Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNPs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and graphene oxide (GO) were used for the first time to treat microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) and create a biocompatible layer with high catalytic surface. Once glucose measurements are critical for diabetes or glycosuria detection and monitoring, the analytical performance of the proposed devices was studied by using bienzymatic colorimetric detection of this carbohydrate. The limit of detection values achieved for glucose with mu PADs treated with MNPs, MWCNT, and GO were 43, 62, and 18 mu M, respectively. The paper surface modification solves problems associated with the lack of homogeneity on color measurements that compromise the sensitivity and detectability levels in clinical diagnosis.","4776":"Silver nanowires (AgNWs) with 200-570 nm in diameter and 20-70 mu m in length were successfully synthesized by a polyol process. The transparent conductive and flexible AgNWs films were fabricated with using the mixed cellulose eater (MCE) as matrix by the improved vacuum filtration process. Then, the optical and electrical and mechanical properties of the AgNWs-MCE films were investigated. For the AgNWs-MCE film produced with a deposition density of 152 mg m(-2), the optical transmission at 550 nm is 81.98 % with R-s around 312 Omega sq(-1), whereas at a deposition density of 190 mg m(-2) an AgNWs-MCE film with an optical transmission of 79.0 % at 550 nm and R-s around 16.6 Omega sq(-1). There is little overt increase in R-s of the AgNWS-MCE film after tape tests for 200 times. The bending test indicated that the change in R-s of AgNWs-MCE film is less than 8 % even after 200 cycles of compressive or tensile bending. The excellent mechanical properties of the AgNWs-MCE film can be attributed to the burying of the AgNWs film at the surface of MCEs. Two 0.5 W LED lamps with series fixed on the surface of AgNWs-MCE film with conductive adhesive were lighted, and they were still luminous after bent.","6263":"In this study electrospun nanofibers of partially sulfonated polyether ether ketone have been produced as a preliminary step for a possible development of composite proton exchange membranes for fuel cells. Response surface methodology has been employed for the modelling and optimization of the electrospinning process, using a Box-Behnken design. The investigation, based on a second order polynomial model, has been focused on the analysis of the effect of both process (voltage, tip-to-collector distance, flow rate) and material (sulfonation degree) variables on the mean fiber diameter. The final model has been verified by a series of statistical tests on the residuals and validated by a comparison procedure of samples at different sulfonation degrees, realized according to optimized conditions, for the production of homogeneous thin nanofibers.","5502":"Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering was applied to study charged lipid exchange between oppositely charged disc-shaped bicelles. The exchange of charged lipids gradually reduces the surface charge density and weakens the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged bicelles which form alternately stacked aggregates upon mixing. Initially, at a high surface charge density with almost no free water layer between the stacked bicelles, fast exchange kinetics dominate the exchange process. At a later stage with a lower surface charge density and a larger water gap between the stacked bicelles, slow exchange kinetics take over. The fast exchange kinetics are correlated with the close contact of the bicelles when there is almost no free water layer between the tightly bound bicelles with a charged lipid exchange time constant as short as 20-40 min. When the water gap becomes large enough to have a free water layer between the stacked bicelles, the fast lipid exchange kinetics are taken over by slow lipid exchange kinetics with time constants around 200-300 min, which are comparable to the typical time constant of lipid exchange between vesicles in aqueous solution. These two kinds of exchange mode fit well with the lipid exchange models of transient hemifusion for the fast mode and monomer exchange for the slow mode.","7354":"With the emergence of one-dimensional (1D) functional nanomaterials and their promising applications, electrospinning (e-spinning) technology and electrospun (e-spun) ultrathin fibers have been widely explored. Melt e-spinning as an ecofriendly method which produces fibers from polymer melt has drawn much attention in recent years. Meanwhile, melt e-spun fibers without any residual solvent provide opportunities in many areas such as tissue engineering, wound dressings, filtration and textiles. In this review, we introduce the basic principles and recent developments of melt e-spinning, and then summarize various heating methods and various materials used in melt e-spinning, and the influence of several parameters. Particularly, several kinds of new melt e-spinning apparatuses (e.g., portable apparatus and apparatus for mass production), 3D fibrous structures and some applications developed recently are reviewed. Finally, we discuss the future prospects and challenges of melt e-spinning.","6711":"In this study, PEUU elastomer was synthesized and nanofibers with five different PEUU\/gelatin ratios (PEUU\/gelatin = 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, 100 : 0, which were called PU0, PU25, PU50, PU75, PU100, respectively) were fabricated via electrospinning. All samples were treated in glutaraldehyde (GA treating) for 24 h. The SEM image results show that there is a uniform distribution for all the nanofibers and the mean fiber diameters increase with the increase in the percentage of PEUU. The FTIR spectra indicate that PEUU was successfully synthesized. The XRD results show that the GA treating process decreased the crystallinity of PEUU to some extent. It can be concluded from the mechanical results that the mechanical properties of PU100 and PU75 nanofibers are superior to other groups. Only a small amount of gelatin significantly improved the hydrophilic properties of the nanofibers. The results of cell proliferation and cell morphology indicate that the PEUU\/gelatin nanofibers, particularly the PU75 group, could better contribute to the cell proliferation than the PU0 and PU100 groups, supporting the application of PU75 in skin tissue engineering. Two different types of electrospun nanoyarns were also fabricated, which showed better comprehensive properties than nanofiber, thus paving way for further research in the tissue engineering field.","6477":"Treatment of cancer is a significant challenge in clinical medicine, and its research is a top priority in chemical biology and drug discovery. Consequently, there is an urgent need for identifying innovative chemotypes capable of modulating unexploited drug targets. The transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels persist scarcely explored as targets, despite intervening in a plethora of pathophysiological events in numerous diseases, including cancer. Both agonists and antagonists have proven capable of evoking phenotype changes leading to either cell death or reduced cell migration. Among these, natural products entail biologically pre-validated and privileged architectures for TRP recognition. Furthermore, several natural products have significantly contributed to our current knowledge on TRP biology. In this Tutorial Review we focus on selected natural products, e.g. capsaicinoids, cannabinoids and terpenes, by highlighting challenges and opportunities in their use as starting points for designing natural productinspired TRP channel modulators. Importantly, the de-orphanization of natural products as TRP channel ligands may leverage their exploration as viable strategy for developing anticancer therapies. Finally, we foresee that TRP channels may be explored for the selective pharmacodelivery of cytotoxic payloads to diseased tissues, providing an innovative platform in chemical biology and molecular medicine.","263":"Distilling and purifying ethanol and other products from second generation lignocellulosic biorefineries adds significant capital and operating costs to biofuel production. The energy usage associated with distillation negatively affects plant gate costs and causes environmental and life-cycle impacts, and the lower titers in fermentation caused by lower sugar concentrations from pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis increase energy and water usage and ethanol production costs. In addition, lower ethanol titers increase the volumes required for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation vessels increase capital expenditure (CAPEX). Therefore, increasing biofuel titers has been a research focus in renewable biofuel production for several decades. In this work, we achieved approximately 230 g L-1 of monomeric sugars after high solid enzymatic hydrolysis using deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) processed corn stover substrates produced at the 100 kg per day scale. The high sugar concentrations and low chemical inhibitor concentrations achieved by the DMR process allowed fermentation to ethanol with titers as high as 86 g L-1, which translates into approximately 10.9% v\/v ethanol. To our knowledge, this is the first time that titers greater than 10% v\/v ethanol in fermentations derived from corn stover without any sugar concentration or purification steps have been reported. The potential cost savings from high sugar and ethanol titers achieved by the DMR process are also reported using TEA analysis.","6261":"Structural diversity and molecular flexibility of phospholipids are essential for biological membranes to play key roles in numerous cellular processes. Uncovering the behavior of individual lipids in membrane dynamics is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions of cell membranes. In this paper, we introduce a simple method to investigate dynamics of lipid molecules in multi-component systems by measuring the P-31 chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions. For achieving both signal separation and CSA determination, we utilized a centerband-only analysis of rotor-unsynchronized spin echo (COARSE). This analysis is based on the curve fitting of periodic modulation of centerband intensity along the interpulse delay time in rotor-unsynchronized spin-echo experiments. The utility of COARSE was examined by using phospholipid vesicles, a three-component lipid raft model system, and archaeal purple membranes. We found that the apparent advantages of this method are high resolution and high sensitivity given by the moderate MAS speed and the one-dimensional acquisition with short spin-echo delays. COARSE provides an alternative method for CSA measurement that is effective in the investigation of lipid polymorphologies.

In comparison with TiO2\/PbS heterojunction, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency was increased almost 50% in the visible region. Meantime, the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were enhanced 200% and 35% respectively. The influence mechanism of CdS is related to reduction of trap state density at TiO2\/PbS interface and PbS QDs surface by the discussion of the dark current density-voltage curves, the transient photocurrent response curves and the electrochemical impedance spectra spectroscopy (EIS).

Nevertheless, the low energy density of SCs still limits their promotion in practical applications. Given this, designing three dimensional (3D) architectures for SC electrodes is perceived as an efficient strategy because well-constructed 3D structures could enable reduced \"dead surface\", good electron transport kinetics, hierarchical porous channels and short ionic diffusion distances. This review aims to describe the current progress of different synthetic processes with respect to the preparation of 3D SC electrodes and focuses on both template-assisted strategies and non-template strategies. We summarize recently proposed methods, novel structures, and electrochemical performances for these 3D electrodes. The advantages and disadvantages accompanying them are also analyzed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of the fabrication of 3D SC electrodes.","2927":"A specific fabrication process has been developed to produce low-cost photomasks using standard consumer products. This process is based on an indirect route, using a numerically controlled excimer laser (KrF) etching technique. It begins with RF-sputtering deposition of a titanium film (200 nm-thick) on float glass substrate. Then a nitrocellulose lacquer, serving as a self-developing resist, is spin-coated on titanium. It is ablated with partially overlapping laser impacts and undergoes self-combustion under laser beam. Proper heat treatments are applied before and after laser ablation to circumvent smearing and adhesion problems. Finally the titanium layer is wet etched through the openings in the resist by dilute hydrofluoric acid. Both nitrocellulose lacquer characterization and laser parameters are discussed. The resolution achieved here (10 mu m, limited by diffraction effects of the laser optics and by side heating of the resist due to the titanium film) is suitable for the fabrication of microwave devices. To confirm the suitability of the proposed process, several photomasks have been fabricated to pattern coplanar tunable stub resonators on ferroelectric KTa0.5Nb0.5O3 thin films. The dielectric permittivity of the KTa0.5Nb0.5O3 material is controlled by DC biasing. A 18% tunability of the stub resonance frequency has been measured in X-band (close to 10 GHz), validating thereby the whole patterning process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses recycled materials (fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and waste Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) glass powder) and Pd-Zr-Ti piezoelectric (PZT) to enhance intelligent functions of original substrates. The volumetric method is used for the design. The control group uses recycled materials to replace cement [0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%]. The PZT group uses a PZT powder to replace 5% of fine aggregates to make cement mortar to test the correlation between engineering and electricity properties of flow, compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and resistivity (electricity at 50 V and 100 V). The mechanical and electrical effects of cement mortar of various groups are discussed to determine the correlation between impedance characteristics and mechanical behavior of cement mortar in different electrical field environments and aqueous states, to build an engineering-electricity relation database for recycled materials and PZT, and to determine the relationships between various variables. A pozzolanic reaction occurs in GGBFS after 7 days. A 30% GGBFS replacement (32.9 MPa) has the maximum compressive strength. A 20% waste LCD glass powder replacement (31.8 MPa) can fill up finer pores and accelerate hydration. The addition of GGBFS and waste LCD glass powder reduces water absorption and internal porosity. Water absorption increases when fly ash is replaced. The resistivity at 50 V is higher than resistivity at 100 V in an electrical field environment. Specifically, in a high voltage environment, the resistivity generated during the delivery process is reduced. Because the voltage increase improves conductivity inside the specimen, the resistivity is reduced. The resistivity increases in correlation with compressive strength in the SSD state of fly ash and GGBFS. The resistivity decreases when the compressive strength increases in the OD state. The resistivity increases when the waste LCD glass powder is replaced in SSD and OD states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, typical micro- and nanofibers are usually free-standing or positioned on a substrate with lower refractive index to ensure the light confinement and guiding mode. Here we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of confining light within a microfiber on a high refractive index substrate. In contrast to the strong leakage to the substrate, we found that the radiation loss was dependent on the radius of the microfiber and the refractive index contrast. Consequently, quasi-guiding modes could be formed and the light could propagate and be amplified in such systems. By fabricating a tapered silica fiber and dye-doped polymer fiber and placing them on sapphire substrates, the light propagation, amplification, and consequent laser behaviors have been experimentally studied to verify the quasi-guiding modes in a microfiber on a higher index substrate. We believe that our research will be essential for the applications of microfibers and on-chip photonic circuits.","2302":"The paper is focused on the aspects of moisture, air, water vapor and heat transfer from human body to the environment, in the case of a textile material (100% cotton knitting fabric with interlock structure), on which a layer of hydrogel or cyclodextrin derivative (mono chloro tryazinil-beta-cyclodextrin) has been deposited, or a multilayer arrangement was executed with chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (Alg) layers, alternately deposited. On the textile surface, one of the following medicines: hydrocortisone acetate (HCr), tacrolimus (TAC) and honokiol (HNK) has been inserted. The active principles are used in coetaneous therapies. One evaluates the comfort elements concerning textile wearing in assembly garments, whose main role is to release a drug from a textile surface to dermis. Tests have been performed on thickness, thermal conductivity, water adsorption, air and vapor permitivity of a basic textile material after chemical treatments meant to insert the hydrogel and cyclodextrin derivative. One obtained a relationship and a general overview between chemical treatments and the textile answer to comfort requirements of a garment, which is a therapeutic support for coetaneous pathologies.","3844":"Cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) were prepared from sisal fiber (SF) and characterized using Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analysis. Further, modification of CMF has been carried out using alkali and silane. Thereafter, modified as well as unmodified CMF reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) biocomposites were fabricated using melt blending technique followed by injection molding. PLA has also been grafted with maleic anhydride and fabricated with unmodified CMF. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements confirmed that the addition of CMF accelerates the crystallization process of the PLA matrix. The NaOH treated SF, i.e. NCMF, reinforced biocomposites exhibited optimum mechanical strength which increased by 21.4% over that of CMF reinforced PLA biocomposites. A silane treated PLA biocomposite showed a maximum impact strength which was 24% higher than that of virgin PLA. The thermal stability of PLA\/CMF biocomposites has been evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis. The scanning electron micrographs also confirmed the uniform dispersion of CMF within the PLA matrix.","3686":"Polydopamine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon has attracted tremendous attention owing to its huge success in improving the electrochemical properties of high-capacity lithium-storage materials (such as S, Si and Sn). In this study, we first demonstrate its excellent and durable lithium-storage capability by designing a one-dimensional hollow structure through a template-assisted method. The polydopamine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon tubes show high specific capacity, excellent rate capability and robust durability. Interestingly, the capacity gradually increased from 587 to 1103 mA h g(-1) upon the 500th cycle at 500 mA g(-1). The self-improvement in capacity stems from the continuous interlamellar spacing expansion of the graphene-like carbon layers as confirmed by HR-TEM. Our work offers a new insight into the electrochemical behaviour of polydopamine-derived carbon and is beneficial for its future utilization in high-performance lithium-ion battery electrode materials.","3622":"A facile, economical and practical technique to fabricate a magnetically assembled colloidal photonic crystal in a polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix was demonstrated by an instant radical polymerization. By taking advantage of the instantaneousness of magnetic assembly, magnetic colloids were successfully assembled into photonic crystal structures with tunable stop bands in aqueous solution. The Bragg diffraction color could be simply controlled by tuning the strength of the external magnetic field to achieve diffraction covering the entire visible spectrum. An appropriate amount of an ionic initiator, APS, was key in the radical polymerization of the photonic crystal hydrogel film. 0.3 mg mL(-1) of APS was chosen, not only to allow a rapid formation of the polyacrylamide hydrogel, but also to avoid coagulation of these magnetic colloids in the hydrogel. Due to the significantly instantaneous properties of magnetic assembly and radical polymerization, coagulation of these magnetic assemblies owing to their long exposure time to an external magnetic field could be prevented. Therefore, a photonic crystal hydrogel film with a uniform diffraction color could be obtained. Notably, the flexible hydrogel film displayed obvious deformation responsiveness. The diffraction light got red-shifted as the level of deformation rose. The achievement in immobilization demonstrates the system to be a major stride toward practical applications in responsive photonic materials.","3454":"The molecular modeling of p-nitroanilinium perchlorate molecule was carried out by using B3LYP and HSEH1PBE levels of density functional theory (DFT). The IR and Raman spectra were simulated and the assignments of vibrational modes were performed on the basis of relative contribution of various internal co-ordinates. NBO analysis was performed to demonstrate charge transfer, conjugative interactions and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions within PNAPC. Obtained large dipole moment values showed that PNAPC is a highly polarizable complex, and the charge transfer occurs within PNAPC. Hydrogen bonding and charge transfer interactions were also displayed by small HOMO-LUMO gap and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface. The strong evidences that the material can be used as an efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) material of PNAPC were demonstrated by considerable polarizability and hyperpolarizability values obtained at DFT levels.","1215":"Increased electrical power generated from a thin-film silicon (TF-Si) photovoltaic device can lead to a reduced cost of electricity production that will support the mass adoption of this technology as a renewable energy source. Extracting the highest conversion efficiency from 'champion' large area TF-Si modules has been the focus of development at TEL Solar AG, Trtibbach. The layer deposition process adjustments and further module technology improvements that led to a significant increase in the absolute stabilized module conversion efficiency of large area (1.43 m(2)) tandem MICROMORPH (TM) modules centered first on obtaining high quality amorphous TF-Si deposited materials for the top cell. This was integrated with microcrystalline TF-Si material for the bottom cell that was deposited under conditions close to the transition point between the amorphous and microcrystalline growth regimes. In an optimized solar cell design the TF-Si materials were then combined with effective light management technologies and an improved module layout. The end result of a world record large area (1.43 m(2)) stabilized module conversion efficiency of 12.34% was certified by the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI). The main technology contributions in the device design for this breakthrough result that generated more than 13.2% stabilized efficiency from each equivalent 1 cm(2) of the active area of the full module are described.

This NF fabric is flexible and thus can be readily tailored into a coin for further cell fabrication. These properties allow volume expansion of the oxide materials and provide shortened diffusion pathways for Li ions than those achieved using the nanoparticle approach. Amorphous SnOx-ZnO particles were uniformly dispersed in the carbon NF (CNF). The SnOx-ZnO CNFs with a Sn:Zn ratio of 3:1 exhibited a superior reversible capacity of 963 mA.h.g(-1) after 55 cycles at a current density of 100 mA.g(-1), which is three times higher than the capacity of graphite-based anodes. The amorphous NFs facilitated Li2O decomposition, thereby enhancing the reversible capacity. ZnO prevented the aggregation of Sn, which, in turn, conferred stable and high discharge capacity to the cell. Overall, the SnOx-ZnO CNFs were shown to exhibit remarkably high capacity retention and high reversible and rate capacities as Li ion battery anodes.","4420":"A high-performance one-dimensional (1D) nanofibrillar N-Co-C oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst was fabricated via electrospinning using renewable natural alginate and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as precursors, where Co nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated by nitrogen (N)-doped amorphous carbon and assembled on MWCNTs. The 1D morphology not only prevents the aggregation of the Co NPs, but also provides a typical multimodal mesoporous structure which is beneficial for the O-2 diffusion and the migration of adsorbed superoxide. In combination with the high conductivity of CNTs, the N-doped amorphous carbon shell can exert electron release on the encapsulated Co NPs, and thus enhance the ORR activity. It is also a protective layer that stabilizes the Co NPs, which ensures a high ORR activity of the catalysts in both alkaline and acid media and long-term durability. So compared with a commercial Pt\/C catalyst, as expected, the N-Co-C nanofiber reported herein exhibited a comparable current density and onset potential (-0.06 V), with better durability in alkaline and acid solutions and better resistance to crossover effects in the ORR.","4140":"Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were functionalized noncovalently by lysozyme (LZ), cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), deoxycholate sodium (NaDC) and polyethylene glycol octylphenol ether (Triton X-100), respectively in this study. Four different kinds of functionalized MWCNTs were employed into dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) as the Pt-free counter electrode (CE). The correlation between the dispersion of MWCNTs and electrochemical active area of CE and the photovoltaic characteristic of DSSC were investigated. Among these four DSSCs, the one with Triton X-100 functionalized MWCNTs showed the best energy conversion efficiency of 2.69% which is 11.16% higher than the DSSC using pristine MWCNTs CE (2.42%), yet the efficiency is lower than the DSSC using Pt CE. While the DSSC with CPC, NaDC and LZ functionalized MWCNTs as the CE showed inferior the photovoltaic conversion efficiency than the DSSC using pristine MWCNTs CE. On analysis of the photovoltaic performance of DSSC and the dispersion of MWCNTs and electrochemical active area of CE, it is found that the high efficiency of the DSSC is associated with the good dispersion of MWCNTs and large electrochemical active area of the counter electrode material.

Here we investigate tunable release of several water-soluble anti-HIV drugs from electrospun fibers fabricated with blends of two biodegradable polyesters. Drug-loaded fibers were fabricated by electrospinning ratios of PCL and PLGA. Fiber morphology was imaged by SEM, and DSC was used to measure thermal properties. HPLC was used to measure drug loading and release from fibers. Cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of drug-loaded fibers were measured in an in vitro cell culture assay. We show programmable release of hydrophilic antiretroviral drugs loaded up to 40 wt%. Incremental tuning of highly-loaded drug fibers within 24 h or > 30 days was achieved by controlling the ratio of PCL and PLGA. Fiber compositions containing higher PCL content yielded greater burst release whereas fibers with higher PLGA content resulted in greater sustained release kinetics. We also demonstrated that our drug-loaded fibers are safe and can sustain inhibition of HIV in vitro. These data suggest that we were able to overcome current limitations associated with sustained release of small molecule hydrophilic drugs at clinically relevant doses. We expect that our system represents an effective strategy to sustain delivery of water-soluble molecules that will benefit a variety of biomedical applications.","965":"Homopolymers and copolymers of the monolignols syringol (S) and guaiacol (G) were prepared as well-defined lignin model compounds. Polymerisation was performed by phenol-formaldehyde condensation, also including the monomer hydroquinone (HQ) to extend the range of redox processes in these synthetic lignins (SLig). The chemical structures of the SLig samples were characterized by C-13 and quantitative P-31 NMR, and the molecular weight was monitored by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Subsequently, SLig were incorporated into two different electron-conducting matrix - single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and polypyrrole (PPy), respectively. As a result, the hybrid materials, with a controlled amount of SWNT or with an unknown amount of PPy, were assembled and compared. The charge storage properties in the investigated materials are attributed to contributions from both the double-layer capacitance of the conducting matrix, and the faradaic reactions provided by quinone groups immobilized in the electrodes. The results indicate a considerable improvement of charge capacity, with the synthetic lignins incorporated in the hybrid materials. With a PPy carrying S, G and HQ, better performance is obtained than has previously been obtained with lignin derivatives, showing a maximum capacity of 94 mA h g(-1). Moreover, a low amount of electronic conductor (20% wt of SWNT) is adequate to perform efficient electron communication between redox active quinones and the electrode surface, providing 72 mA h g(-1).","2354":"M-type barium hexaferrites doped with Sm3+, Ba1-xSmxFe12O19 (x=0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.50) were prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique. Occupation of Sm3+ ions in Ba1-xSmxFe12O19 was investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray photoelectron spectrum. The changes of crystal cell volume and valency of Sm, Ba and Fe ions indicated that Sm3+ occupied Ba2+ sites and Fe3+ ions were partially reduced to Fe2+ ions to keep the valence neutrality.

The electronic effect of substituents had a considerable effect on the reaction. A plot of Hammett parameters of substituents vs. degree of substitution (DS) of resultant cellulose esters exhibited a V-shaped graph: a negative slope for negative Hammett parameters, and a positive slope for positive Hammett parameters. Such a Hammett plot indicated the mechanism of cellulose benzoylation: the reaction underwent a unimolecular ionization mechanism with a carbocationic intermediate when benzoyl chlorides were with electron-donating substituents, and a bimolecular addition-elimination mechanism with a tetrahedral intermediate when benzoyl chlorides were with electron-withdrawing substituents. In addition, C-13-NMR analysis showed that most of the substituted benzoyl chlorides exclusively preferred the primary hydroxyl at the C-6 position. This unusually high regioselectivity was attributed to the synergistic effect of appropriate reaction rate, moderate steric effect and reaction mechanism of benzoylation.","711":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), a worldwide leading cause of mortali0 and morbidity, are generated mainly by atherosclerosis. The serum fatty adds (FA) and some of their peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxytrans-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and malondyaldehyde (MDA), are known risk factors for CVD. Ouraim was to determine in atherogenically-modified low-densiOpoproteins (LDL), either oxidized or glycated, the FA composition, quantify the levels of 4-HNE, MDA and of cholesterol's main oxidation product, 7-kethocholesterol (7-KC). Profiles of FA, conjugated dienes, 4-HNE, MDA and 7-KC were determined in native LDL (nLDL) isolated from blood donors from the Hematology Center, Bucharest, copper-oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and non-enzymatically glycated LDL (gLDL). The FA composition was determined by Gas Chromatography with a flame ionization detector and the conjugated dienes by absorbtion in UV at 234 nm. Free 4-HNE and 7-KC levels were determined by Gas-Chromatography Triple Quadrupol Mass Spectrometry in Electron Ionization mode and total MDA by reversed-phase Ultra High Performance Lichid Chromatography. Results showed that the polyunsaturated fatty adds (PUFAs) were totally reduced in oxLDL (except linoleic add) and decreased in gLDL, while the monounsaturated fatty acids remained almost unchanged in both oxLDL and gLDL. Lipid peroxidation products increased as follows: conjugated dienes were significantly increased both in gLDL (29%, p<0.05) and oxLDL (1.5 fold higher, p<0.01) compared to nLDL; free 4-HNE level in oxLDL (2.75 +\/- 1.01 nmoles\/mg protein) was 100 times the level in nLDL (0.02 +\/- 0.01 nmoles\/mg protein), while gLDL (0.05 +\/- 0.02 nmoles\/mg protein) had only twice the nLDL level; MDA levels in oxLDL were statistically increased (1.05 +\/- 0.44 nmoles\/mg protein) compared to nLDL (0.05 0.02 nmoles\/ mg protein) and to gLDL (0.19 +\/- 0.05 nmoles\/mg protein); 7-KC level was significantly increased in oxLDL (674.39 +\/- 207.70 nmoles\/mg protein) and gLDL (1.21 +\/- 0.32 nmoles\/mg protein) compared to nLDL (0.13 +\/- 0.04 nmoles\/mg protein). Our data demonstrate that the alteration of the FA composition of moded LDL has two negative consequences: (i the reduction of PUFA levels, most importantly the essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and (ii) the increase of the main peroxidation products of FA and cholesterol such as conjugated dienes, free 4-HNE, MDA and 7-KC, transforming LDL into atherogenic lipoproteins.","6101":"Bicontinuous cubic structures offer enormous potential in applications ranging from protein crystallisation to drug delivery systems and have been observed in cellular membrane structures. One of the current bottlenecks in understanding and exploiting these structures is that cubic scaffolds produced in vitro are considerably smaller in size than those observed in biological systems, differing by almost an order of magnitude in some cases. We have addressed this technological bottleneck and developed a methodology capable of manufacturing highly swollen bicontinuous cubic membranes with length scales approaching those seen in vivo. Crucially, these cubic systems do not require the presence of proteins. We have generated highly swollen Im3m symmetry bicontinuous cubic phases with lattice parameters of up to 480 angstrom, composed of ternary mixtures of monoolein, cholesterol and negatively charged lipid (DOPS or DOPG) and we have been able to tune their lattice parameters. The swollen cubic phases are highly sensitive to both temperature and pressure; these structural changes are likely to be controlled by a fine balance between lipid headgroup repulsions and lateral pressure in the hydrocarbon chain region.","5872":"A new DMSO-compatible aligning gel based on cross-linked poly(2-hydroxylethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) has been developed. Due to a significant difference in bulk magnetic susceptibility between the DMSO inside and outside the gel, it is possible to simultaneously collect isotropic and anisotropic NMR data, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDC), in the same NMR tube. RDC-assisted structural analysis of menthol and the alkaloid retrorsine is reported as proof of concept.","5074":"CONSPECTUS: The structures of membrane-bound polypeptides are intimately related to their functions and may change dramatically with the lipid environment. Circular dichroism (CD) is a rapid analytical method that requires relatively low amounts of material and no labeling. Conventional CD is routinely used to monitor the secondary structure of peptides and proteins in solution, for example, in the presence of ligands and other binding partners. In the case of membrane-active peptides and transmembrane proteins, these measurements can be applied to, and remain limited to, samples containing detergent micelles or small sonicated lipid vesicles. Such traditional CD analysis reveals only secondary structures. With the help of an oriented circular dichroism (OCD) setup, however, based on the preparation of macroscopically oriented lipid bilayers, it is possible to address the membrane alignment of a peptide in addition to its conformation. This approach has been mostly used for alpha-helical peptides so far, but other structural elements are conceivable as well. OCD analysis relies on Moffitt's, theory, which predicts that the electronic transition dipole moments of the backbone amide bonds in helical polypeptides are polarized either parallel or perpendicular to the helix axis. The interaction of the electric field vector of the circularly polarized light with these transitions results in an OCD spectrum of a membrane-bound a-helical peptide, which exhibits a characteristic line shape and reflects the angle between \"the helix axis and the bilayer normal. For parallel alignment of a peptide helix with respect to the membrane surface (S-state), the corresponding \"fingerprint\" CD band around 208 nm will exhibit maximum negative amplitude. If the helix changes its alignment via an obliquely tilted (T-state) to a fully inserted transmembrane orientation (I-state), the ellipticity at 208 nm decreases and the value approaches zero due to the decreased interactions between the field and the transition dipole. Compared to conventional CD, OCD data are not only collected in the biologically relevant environment of a highly hydrated planar lipid bilayer (whose composition can be varied at will), but in addition it provides information about the tilt angle of the polypeptide in the membrane. It is the method of choice for screening numerous different conditions, such as peptide concentration, lipid composition, membrane additives, pH, temperature, and sample hydration. All these factors have been found to affect the peptide alignment in membrane, while having little or no influence on conformation. In many cases, the observed realignment could be related to biological action, such as pore formation by antimicrobial and cell-penetrating peptides, or to binding events of transmembrane segments of integral membrane proteins. Likewise, any lipid -induced conversion from alpha-helix to beta-sheeted conformation is readily picked up by OCD and has been interpreted in terms of protein instability or amyloidformation.","496":"Hitherto, electron transfer (ET) between redox proteins has been deemed to occur via donor-acceptor binding, and diffusible reactive species are considered as deleterious side-products in such systems. Herein, ET from cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, an animal membrane flavoprotein) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP, a plant hemoprotein) to cytochrome c (Cyt c, a soluble animal hemoprotein) was probed under diverse conditions, using standard assays. ET in the CPR-Cyt c system was critically inhibited by cyanide and sub-equivalent levels of polar one-electron cyclers like copper ions, vitamin C\/Trolox and superoxide dismutase. In the presence of lipids, inhibition was also afforded by amphipathic molecules vitamin E, palmitoyl-vitamin C and the membrane hemoprotein, cytochrome b(5). Such nonspecific inhibition (by diverse agents in both aqueous and lipid phases) indicated that electron transfer\/relay was effected by small diffusible agents, whose lifetimes are shortened by the diverse radical scavengers. When CPR was retained in a dialysis membrane and Cyt c presented outside in free solution, ET was still observed. Further, HRP (taken at nM levels) catalyzed oxidation of a phenolic substrate was significantly inhibited upon the incorporation of sub-nM levels of Cyt c. The findings imply that CPR-Cyt c or HRP-Cyt c binding is not crucial for ET. Further, fundamental quantitative arguments (based on diffusion\/collision) challenge the erstwhile protein-protein binding-assisted ET hypothesis. It is proven beyond reasonable doubt that mobile and diffusible electron carriers (ions and radicals) serve as \"redox-relay agents\" in the biological ET models\/setup studied.","6536":"A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) coated Li4Ti5O12 (LTO\/PP) composite is synthesized by a facile and convenient approach, which involves dispersing LTO in an aqueous solution of PEDOT: PSS, followed by rotary evaporation accompanied by an ultrasonic procedure. After the coating process, LTO is covered by a homogeneous PEDOT: PSS layer, which effectively improves the electrical conductivity and processing capability of LTO to form a more homogeneous electrode sheet, and thus impart more favorable electrochemical kinetics as compared with the pristine LTO electrode. The LTO\/PP electrode exhibits better reversible capacity and rate capability compared with the LTO electrode, delivering a reversible capacity of 177.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and reaching a capacity of 169.1 mA h g(-1) with a capacity retention of 97.8% after 100 cycles at 0.5C. At the rate of 10C, the LTO\/PP electrode delivers a capacity as high as 161.1 mA h g(-1) (91.0% of the value achieved at 0.1C), as compared to 144.5 mA h g(-1) for the pristine LTO electrode.","1061":"In the present study, polysaccharides were extracted from ginseng with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) after consecutive hot water and alpha-amylase extraction. The yield of EDTA-soluble ginseng polysaccharide (EGP) was 6.0%. Using anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography, EGP was fractionated into one major starch-like glucan (EGP-N), two minor glucan fractions (EGP-1a and EGP-1b) and four pectic fractions (EGP-2a, EGP-2b, EGP-3a and EGP-3b). High-performance liquid chromatography, fourier transform-infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that the four pectic fractions were composed of both homogalacturonan and type-I rhamnogalacturonan domains. EGP had a better stimulation effect on lymphocyte proliferation in vivo than hot water and alpha-amylase extracted polysaccharides, demonstrating that some novel and active polysaccharides can be extracted from ginseng by EDTA. These results provide new insight into the preparation of ginseng polysaccharides that may have potential use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.","6250":"Effects were shown for the composition and post-synthesis heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere on the electrochemical properties of nanocomposites derived from polypyrrole (PPy) and a V2O5 xerogel with host-guest structure. PPy0.05V2O5 was found to have the highest specific discharge capacity of about 290 mA center dot h\/g and high stability upon prolonged charge-discharge cycling among the PPyxV2O5 nanocomposites prepared (where x = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025). Post-synthesis heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere leads to oxidation of the reduced portion of the inorganic nanocomposite component and nanostructurization of the composite with formation of nanofibers that facilitate a considerable increase in the specific capacity and stability upon cycling.","4127":"Highly selective and efficient enrichment of glycans from complex biological samples is of great significance for the discovery and diagnosis of disease via identifying the related biomarkers. Mesoporous carbon materials were widely employed for the selective enrichment of glycans due to the strong interactions between carbon and glycans. In this study, novel carbon-functionalized ordered magnetic mesoporous silica composites (denoted as Fe3O4@3SiO(2)@mSiO(2)-C) with a core-shell structure, high carbon content, excellent hydrophilic property and unique magnetic character were designed and synthesized. A strategy involving CTAB as the mesoporous structure-directing agent and the carbon precursor during in situ carbonization was proposed. Besides, a compact silica layer with adequate thickness was essential to protect the magnetic core during the sulphonation process in further high-temperature calcination. As a result, the obtained Fe3O4@3SiO(2)@mSiO(2)-C composites exhibited a high carbon content (25%) with graphite structure, rapid magnetic separation (within 10 s), large pore volume (0.257 m(3) g(-1)), high BET surface area (269.14 m(2) g(-1)) and a well-ordered mesostructure (3.39 nm). In addition, a strong magnetic response with a saturation magnetization value (59.8 emu g(-1)) has been confirmed. By taking the advantage of the special interaction between the carbon and glycans, the size-exclusion ability and highly hydrophilic as well as unique magnetic properties, the Fe3O4@3SiO(2)@mSiO(2)-C composites exhibit satisfying enrichment ability in glycomic analysis. Better selectivity and efficiency than active carbon have been confirmed. Furthermore, 42 N-linked glycans with sufficient peak intensities were obtained from human serum after treatment with the Fe3O4@3SiO(2)@mSiO(2)-C composites, showing great potential as a tool for the enrichment and detection of glycans in biological samples.","4655":"Hydrazine is often regarded as one of the most appealing fuels for fuel cells due to its high energy content, and also because it gives off only environmentally benign byproducts when it is used in fuel cells (cf. many other fuels produce the greenhouse gas CO2). However, current electrocatalysts for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HOR) in direct hydrazine fuel cells involve the expensive, unsustainable noble metals such as Pt. Herein, using cellulose filter paper both as a precursor and a self-template, we show the synthesis of nanoporous carbon electrocatalysts that can efficiently electrocatalyze HOR. To make the electrocatalysts, first cellulose filter paper is modified with metal- amine complexes and then with silica shells. After carbonization of the resulting composite material at different temperatures, followed by removal of the silica shells, nanoporous carbon-based electrocatalysts are obtained. Notably, the intert-wined structure of the cellulose matrix in the filter paper is taken advantage of to serve as a self-template, allowing the formation of the desired fibrous, nanoporous carbon electrocatalysts. The materials show a good electrocatalytic activity toward HOR, giving a low overpotential and a high current density. Thus, such nanoporous carbons can be good candidate materials to replace conventional metal-based catalysts commonly used in HOR and other related reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we use a simple approach to generate a fluorescent composite of quantum dots\/gelatin with reversible sol-gel transition triggered by temperature stimuli. We initially prepared the aqueous CdS quantum dots with clear yellow fluorescence by a single-step process. These CdS quantum dots can reserve their fluorescence after they were combined with gelatin. Specifically, rheological measurements and vial inversion tests both confirm that CdS quantum dots\/gelatin composite can undergo reversible sol-gel transition initiated by temperature stimuli near physiological temperature. Furthermore, it is shown that loading, preservation and release of CdS quantum dots in aqueous medium can be controlled by adjusting the temperature to trigger the sol-gel transition of the composite. Consequently, it can be expected that this fluorescent quantum dots\/gelatin composite with thermo-responsive and reversible sol-gel transition has promising applications in biomedical fields such as bioimaging, biosensing, and drug delivery.","1872":"We report a facile synthesis method for carbon nanofiber (CNF) supported Pd catalysts via one-pot electrospinning and their application for nitrite hydrogenation. A mixture of Pd acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)(2)), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and nonfunctionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was electrospun and thermally treated to produce Pd\/CNF-MWCNT catalysts. The addition of MWCNTs with a mass loading of 1.0-2.5 wt % (to PAN) significantly improved nitrite reduction activity compared to the catalyst without MWCNT addition. The results of CO chemisorption confirmed that the addition of MWCNTs increased Pd exposure on CNFs and hence improved catalytic activity.","3905":"In this work, a novel flexible MWCNTs@MoO2-C nanocable composite for lithium ion battery anodes was fabricated by the electrospinning of homogeneously dispersed MWCNTs in a PVA\/ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution and subsequent thermal treatment of the electrospun nanofibers. In the resulting MWCNTs@MoO2-C nanocable composite, the MoO2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in amorphous carbon nanofibers that contained well-embedded MWCNTs as their cores. Compared with samples without MWCNTs, the unique nanocable composite exhibited not only a high specific capacity but also excellent cycling performance and good flexibility. It delivered a high reversible capacity of 832 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) after 30 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the MWCNTs@MoO2-C nanocable composite was attributed to its novel nanocable structure ensuring not only effective contact between MoO2 and the liquid electrolyte, but also high conductivity for Li+ and e(-) transfer.","4934":"Advances in materials chemistry are necessary for low-cost energy storage to support energy generation from renewable sources and electric transportation. Renewable biopolymers, such as sodium lignosulfate (SLS), have attracted interest for electrodes when mixed with conducting polymers due to their higher charge-capacity and natural abundance. The availability of SLS is limited and will continue to decrease, while alkali lignin (AL), which accounts for 98% of lignin from paper-pulping, exhibits poor solubility in acidic electrolytes used for electropolymerization of conducting polymers. Here, we utilize organic acid solvents to overcome processing limitations in order to synthesize electrodes comprising polypyrrole (PPy) and SLS. Compared to PPy\/SLS, electrodes containing PPy\/AL exhibit an increase in capacitance from 312 F g(-1) to 444 F g(-1), and a decrease in relaxation time constant from 1.7 to 1 s. Furthermore, we showed that the electrochemical performance of PPy\/AL electrodes could be further increased by incorporating AL with higher phenolic content that is obtained from an elevated-temperature, pH-driven fractionation process.","2858":"The practical applications of transition metal oxides and hydroxides for supercapacitors are restricted by their intrinsic poor conductivity, large volumetric expansion, and rapid capacitance fading upon cycling, which can be solved by optimizing these materials to nanostructures and confining them within conductive carbonaceous frameworks. In this work, flexible hybrid membranes with ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanoplatelets vertically and uniformly anchored on the electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNF) have been facilely prepared as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The Ni(OH)(2)\/CNF hybrid membranes with three-dimensional macroporous architectures as well as hierarchical nanostructures can provide open and continuous channels for rapid diffusion of electrolyte to access the electrochemically active Ni(OH)(2) nanoplatelets. Moreover, the carbon nanofiber can act both as a conductive core to provide efficient transport of electrons for fast Faradaic redox reactions of the Ni(OH)(2) sheath, and as a buffering matrix to mitigate the local volumetric expansion\/contraction upon long-term cycling. As a consequence, the optimized Ni(OH)(2)\/CNF hybrid membrane exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2523 F (based on the mass of Ni(OH)(2), that is 701 F g(-1) based on the total mass) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). The Ni(OH)(2)\/CNF hybrid membranes with high mechanical flexibility, superior electrical conductivity, and remarkably improved electrochemical capacitance are condsidered as promising flexible electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.","1732":"In this article, the challenge of providing electrical cue through a soft polymeric neural scaffold for directional neuron growth has been studied. Aligned multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) chitosan composite scaffolds are successfully fabricated using electric field alignment technique. Uniform distribution and alignment of 0.5 wt% MWCNTs in the chitosan matrix, good interfacial bonding, and aligned network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) help to improve the elastic modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength by 12.7%, 21.9%, and 11.2%, respectively, as compared with the random MWCNT-chitosan scaffold. Alignment of MWCNTs introduces highly anisotropic electrical conductivity (100,000 times higher) along its direction, as compared to the transverse direction of the scaffold. This is the ideal requirement for a neural scaffold to guide cells in the appropriate direction. Interactions of HT-22 hippocampal neurons with MWCNT-chitosan matrix prove the scaffolds to be highly biocompatible with a notable increase in viability. In addition, 50-60% of neurons are found to be aligned in the MWCNT alignment direction of the scaffold. These results indicate that aligned MWCNT-chitosan scaffold is a potential design to control the directional cell migration on the scaffold, which opens up the possibility of its use in repopulating cells in regions of acute neuronal loss.

Both electrodes were fabricated using an environmentally friendly cellulose-based binding agent. The performance of the new lithium-ion battery was evaluated with a conventional, carbonate-based electrolyte (ethylene carbonate:diethyl carbonate-1m lithium hexafluorophosphate, EC:DEC 1m LiPF6) and an ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolyte (N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide-0.2m lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, Pyr(14)TFSI 0.2m LiTFSI), respectively. Galvanostatic charge\/discharge tests revealed a reduced rate capability of the TMO-C\/Pyr(14)TFSI 0.2m LiTFSI\/NMC full-cell compared to the organic electrolyte, but the coulombic efficiency was significantly enhanced. Moreover, the IL-based electrolyte substantially improves the safety of the system due to a higher thermal stability of the formed anodic solid electrolyte interphase and the IL electrolyte itself. While the carbonate-based electrolyte shows sudden degradation reactions, the IL exhibits a slowly increasing heat flow, which does not constitute a serious safety risk.","5521":"The chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) typically involves highly toxic reducing agents which could contaminate and have a negative effect on the conductivity of the resulting materials. Herein we report a facile approach to prepare stable reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aqueous colloids using reduced polyaniline nanofiber (rPANI-NFs) as both a reducing and a stabilizing agent. The efficient reduction of GO is verified by infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorption of polyaniline nanofibers onto the rGO nanosheets allows a stable rGO aqueous dispersion to be formed through electrostatic stabilization. Since the rPANI-NFs could be easily doped and converted to a highly conductive material after reduction of GO, this approach provided a new method for large-scale production of aqueous rGO dispersions with great potential applications in environmentally friendly waterborne conductive coatings and construction of various graphene-based materials as demonstrated in this study of cellulose nanofiber-graphene composites.","1718":"Friction conditions at the contact of bodies are connected with the structure of the contact area, in particular, with occurring the products of their destruction or severe deformation in this area such that further interaction of bodies takes place through the elements of the structure of an intermediate layer. A mechanism of internal motions in the intermediate layer which can alter its structure at friction is demonstrated and analyzed in the paper. The conditions and basic mechanism adjusting the formation of the structure at the interface at friction are determined. The interaction between the bodies is carried out by rolling between the structural elements of the intermediate layer (balls). Loads from contacting bodies lead to the convergence of balls with increasing total tangential displacements. This process is represented as an analog of the transformed (viscous) friction, whereby when the body is moved with friction on the surface under the action of some force then the appearance of an additional force of another direction is also accompanied by the displacement of the body in the direction of this force no matter how small it may be. This approach can be extended for an analysis of a system of blocks in the intermediate layer if their relative motion occurs in the sliding regime. An analytical model of convergence of the rolling elements at the interface under shear with compression on the basis of the laws of the transformed (viscous) friction was suggested. The model was confirmed experimentally. It is shown that the rate of convergence does not depend on the direction of the main drawing together of contacting bodies. The speed of convergence increases with the decreasing the distance between the balls until they touch. The described process represents a basis for the scenario of the particles grouping in the intermediate layer and aligning them into compact formations. Accounting for this phenomenon can be useful for technological processes such as chemical-mechanical polishing. Mutual influence and motion of abrasive particles, formation of their conglomerates can change the intensity of their action on the treated surface.","1918":"CONDUCTING polymers have attracted much attention in view of scientific interest, simple preparation method and practical applications. This article demonstrates the preparation of an electrically conductive composite based on (poly aniline, silver nanoparticles, nitrocellulose resin) by mixing the three components with each other by sonication. Poly aniline (PANI) doped with HCl was prepared by chemical oxidation pathway using potassium peroxydisulphate while silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) was synthesized via chemical reduction process using oleic acid and oleyl amine. The prepared materials were characterized by spectroscopic measurements (FTIR, UV-vis, TEM), in addition to thermal analysis (TGA, DSC). The electrical conductivity was measured by four-point probe method. The achieved results indicated high performance properties for the nano-composite to be applied in conducting inks.","5905":"Immobilization into 3D matrices stabilizes proteins in comparison to flat planar surfaces and facilitates the study of the biomolecular interactions as well as integration into optrodes for cell physiology. Photocrosslinkable hydrogels have received significant attention in recent years as they provide not only a highly hydrophilic 3D environment to promote protein stabilization and its interactions with analyte molecules, but enable optically addressable patterning for spatial control of protein localization. At the same time, the explosion of new genetically encoded sensor proteins has greatly expanded the range of optical molecular sensors for cell physiology. Here we integrate a genetically encoded glutamate sensor protein into a photocrosslinkable hydrogel via covalent interaction to create a novel glutamate sensor material. Protein immobilization can be achieved through covalent bonds, physical interactions, or physical entrapment. Although physical entrapment without chemical modifications offers a universal approach for protein immobilization, leaching of protein through the pores of the hydrogel is a significant challenge. Thus, here an alternative method is developed to provide better control of protein localization and immobilization using naturally existing reactive groups of proteins. To this end, a genetically encoded FRET based glutamate indicator protein (FLIPE) is modified with diacrylated poly (ethylene glycol) (PEGDA) by Michael-type addition between acrylate groups and the thiol side chains of the cysteine residues. We optimize the molecular weight of PEGDA (300, 740, and 3400 Da) as well as concentrations of the photoinitiator (0.1, 0.5 and 1 % (w\/w)) and monomer (10, 20, and 30 % (w\/w)) in the precursor solution. Next the precursor solution is grown at the distal end of an optical fiber to test the spectroscopic properties and characteristic bioactivities of proteins in the hydrogel network. Optimization of the irradiation parameters, light intensity and exposure time, improves the spatial resolution of 3D hydrogel tips. This study examines the capability of fabricating 3D hydrogel sensors covalently modified with a member of recently growing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, which can later be extended to all conformation-dependent protein biosensors and be used intracellularly for physiological and biological sensing purposes.","6943":"We report a synthetic approach to form. octahedral Cu2O microcrystals with a tunable edge length and demonstrate their use as catalysts for the photodegradation of aromatic organic compounds. In this particular study, the effects of the Cu2+ and reductant concentrations and stoichiometric ratios were carefully examined to identify their roles in controlling the final material composition and size under sustainable reaction conditions. Varying the ratio and concentrations of Cu2+ and reductant added during the synthesis determined the final: morphology and composition of the structures. Octahedral particles were prepared at selected Cu2+:glucose ratios that demonstrated a range of photocatalytic reactivity. The results indicate that material composition, surface area, and substrate charge effects play important roles in controlling the overall reaction rate. In addition, analysis of the post-reacted materials revealed photocorrosion was inhibited and that surface etching had preferentially occurred at the particle edges during the reaction, suggesting that the reaction predominately occurred at these interfaces. Such results advance the Understanding of how size and. composition affect the surface interface and catalytic functionality of materials.","2131":"A pH- and temperature-responsive magnetic adsorbent [poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) grafted chitosan\/Fe3O4 composite particles, CN-MCP], was synthesized for the removal Of the endocrine-disrupting chemical nonylphenol. According to the structural characteristics (changeable surface-charge and hydrophilic\/hydrophobic properties) of the targeted contaminant, CN-MCP was designed owning special structure (pH- and temperature-responsiveness for the changeable surface-charge and adjustable hydrophilic\/hydrophobic properties, respectively). Compared to chitosan magnetic composite particles without grafting modification (CS-MCP) and several other reported adsorbents, CN-MCP exhibited relatively high adsorption capacity for nonylphenol under corresponding optimal conditions (123 mg\/g at pH 9 and 20 degrees C; 116 mg\/g at pH 5 and 40 degrees C). Meanwhile, high selectivity of the novel adsorbent in selective adsorption of nonylphenol from bisolute solution of nonylphenol and phenol was found. Effects of grafting ratio of the grafted polymer branches and coexisting inorganic salts on the adsorption were systematically investigated. Moreover, CN-MCP demonstrated desired reusability during 20 times of adsorption desorption recycling. The high adsorption capacity, high selectivity, and desired reusability aforementioned revealed the significant application potential of CN-MCP in the removal of NP. On the basis of the adsorption behaviors, isotherms equilibrium, thermodynamics and kinetics studies, and instrumental analyses including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET specific surface area, zeta potential, and static water contact angle measurements, distinct adsorption mechanisms were found under various conditions: charge attraction between CN-MCP and the contaminant, as well as binding between polymeric branches of CN-MCP and nonyls, contributed to the adsorption at pH 9 and 20 degrees C; whereas hydrophobic interaction between CN-MCP and nonylphenol played a dominant role at pH 5 and 40 degrees C. The current study provided a strategy for the structural design of adsorbents according to the features of targeted emerging contaminants, and the continuity of the work was discussed and proposed.","5483":"The objective of this research was to develop a sustainable industry manufacturing method for direct recycling cemented carbide tool scraps combining a hydrothermal and electrolysis process (CHEP). The research methodology was performed by studying the current recycling carbide tools, scrap industry and associated recycling technologies. A tungsten carbides (WC) recycling technology was designed by using an electrochemical cell comprising of a titanium cathode, titanium anode and hydrochloric acid (HCl) electrolyte under controlled temperature. Finally, the speed of binder phase removal, key process variables, WC leached and recovered WC purity rates were examined and identified. The results of this research indicated that this recycling process was effective in recycling cemented carbide from industrial cutting tools scraps. This technology can be used to purify the recovered WC rate to near virgin material, resulting in a more environmentally friendly process and reducing natural tungsten material usage.","319":"Highly acidic, functionalized, carbonized glycerol nanotubes successfully synthesized via a simultaneous carbonization and acidification have been identified as efficient and stable solid acid catalysts for biofuel production from glycerol and levulinic acid.","4121":"Electrospun nanofiber membranes having a hierarchical structure with multilevel roughness were generated via electrospinning of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-SiO2 blend solutions. The composite PVDF-SiO2 nanofiber membranes were then endowed with superhydrophobicity by the fluorosilanization of the surface with low surface energy fluoroalkylsilane (FAS). The results showed that when the SiO2 content in the dope solutions increased from 0 wt% to 8 wt%, the water contact angles of the FAS modified nanofiber membranes increased significantly from 130.4 degrees to 160.5 degrees. The increment of the silica content in the dope solutions decreased the fiber diameters and pore sizes of the modified membranes, while the mechanical properties were enhanced with the silica addition. The liquid entry pressures of the membranes increased gradually from 84 kPa to 195 kPa with silica addition due to the increased contact angles and decreased pore size. Vacuum membrane distillation experiments were carried out for the modified nanofiber membranes to evaluate the anti-wetting properties. The optimal superhydrophobic nanofiber membrane maintained a stable flux of 31.5 kg m(-2) h(-1) with a permeate conductivity approximately 10 mu s cm(-1) over the entire test, while the fluxes and conductivities of the nanofiber membranes without superhydrophobicity showed a significant decrease and increase, respectively. The results indicated that the superhydrophobic modification process rendered the nanofiber membrane anti-wetting properties without compromising its excellent permeability.","7004":"Fabricating protein adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and appreciable throughput is extremely important and highly desired for. the separation and purification of protein products in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries, yet still remains a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel protein adsorbent by in situ functionalizing eletrospun ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) nanofibrous membranes (NFM) with critic acid (CCA). Taking advantage of the merits of large specific surface area, highly tortuous Open-porous structure, abundant active carboxyl groups introduced by CCA, superior chemical stability, and robust mechanical strength, the obtained CCA-grafted EVOH NFM (EVOH-CCA NFM) present an excellent integrated protein (take lysozyme as the model protein) adsorption performance with a high capacity of 284 mg g(-1), short equilibrium time of 6 h, ease of elution, and good reusability. Meanwhile, the adsorption performance of EVOH-CCA NFM can be optimized by regulating buffer pH, ionic strength, and initial concentration of protein solutions. More importantly, a dynamic binding efficiency of 250 mg g(-1) can be achieved driven solely by the gravity of protein solution, which matches well with the demands of the high yield and energy conservation in the actual protein purification process. Furthermore, the resultant EVOH-CCA NFM also possess unique selectivity for positively charged proteins which was confirmed by the method of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Significantly, the successful synthesis of such intriguing and economic EVOH-CCA NFM may provide a promising candidate for the next generation of protein adsorbents for rapid, massive; and cost-effective separation and purification of proteins.","1850":"Although penguins live in the world's coldest environment, frost and ice are seldom found on their feathers. That is to say, their feathers exhibit excellent antifrosting or anti-icing properties. We found that their air-infused microscale and nanoscale hierarchical rough structures endow the body feathers of penguins Spheniscus humboldti with hydrophobicity (water CA approximate to 147 degrees) and antiadhesion characteristics (water adhesive force approximate to 23.4 mu N), even for supercooled water microdroplets. A polyimide nanofiber membrane with novel microstructures was prepared on an asymmetric electrode by electrospinning, acting as an artificial replica of a penguin's body feather. The unique microstructure of the polyimide nanofiber membrane results in a density gradient of the surface chemical substance, which is crucial to the formation of gradient changes of the contact angle and adhesive force. With decrease of the density of the surface chemical substance (i.e., with increase of the distance between adjacent fibers), the static water contact angles decreased from similar to 154 degrees to similar to 105 degrees and the water adhesion forces increased from 37 to 102 mu N. Polyimide nanofibers pin a few supercooled water microdroplets. By increasing the distance of adjacent polyimide fibers, coalescence between the pinned water microdroplets was prevented. The polyimide fiber membrane achieved icephobicity.","7338":"High quality single crystal hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanocubes with average dimensions of 40 nm were successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. Systematic analyses were performed to investigate the morphological-, structural-and optical-properties of the as-synthesized alpha-Fe2O3 nanocubes. Continuous formation and hourly monitoring towards proper arrangement of single crystal alpha-Fe2O3 nanocubes was observed throughout the hydrothermal heating process of 180 degrees C from 4 h to 12 h. The probable growth mechanism on the formation of cubic nanostructures is also proposed. Electron micrographs show the cubic alpha-Fe2O3 synthesized at the most optimum 8 h hydrothermal heating duration are indeed produced in high-yield with a well-defined cubical shape. The typical rhombohedral structure of cubic alpha-Fe2O3 was evident from the XRD pattern. The SAED pattern indicates that the alpha-Fe2O3 nanocubes are single-crystalline in nature, with lattice-fringes and a d-spacing value of 3.6 angstrom. The optical characterization reveals that alpha-Fe2O3 nanocubes show strong visible-light absorption with a band gap energy of similar to 2.1 eV while the photoluminescence emission spectra depicts a mono-peak centered at similar to 590 nm. Both the SAED pattern and UV-vis spectra show a strong correlation with the standard alpha-Fe2O3. The as-synthesized alpha-Fe2O3 single crystal is of high quality that potentially could be used as a visible-light active nanomaterial in renewable energy device applications.","3333":"In this paper, we review the recent advances which have taken place in the understanding and applications of acoustic\/elastic metamaterials. Metamaterials are artificially created composite materials which exhibit unusual properties that are not found in nature. We begin with presenting arguments from discrete systems which support the case for the existence of unusual material properties such as tensorial and\/or negative density. The arguments are then extended to elastic continuums through coherent averaging principles. The resulting coupled and nonlocal homogenized relations, called the Willis relations, are presented as the natural description of inhomogeneous elastodynamics. They are specialized to Bloch waves propagating in periodic composites and we show that the Willis properties display the unusual behavior which is often required in metamaterial applications such as the Veselago lens. We finally present the recent advances in the area of transformation elastodynamics, charting its inspirations from transformation optics, clarifying its particular challenges, and identifying its connection with the constitutive relations of the Willis and the Cosserat types.","4290":"Thermal energy is abundantly available, and especially low-grade heat is often wasted in industrial processes as a by-product. Tapping into this vast energy reservoir with cost-attractive technologies may become a key element for the transition to an energy-sustainable economy and society. We propose a novel heat-to-current converter which is based on the temperature dependence of the cell voltage of charged supercapacitors. Using a commercially available supercapacitor, we observed a thermal cell-voltage rise of around 0.6 mV K-1 over a temperature window of 0 degrees C to 65 degrees C. Within our theoretical model, this can be used to operate a Stirling-like charge-voltage cycle whose efficiency is competitive to the most-efficient thermoelectric (Seebeck) engines. Our proposed heat-to-current converter is built from cheap materials, contains no moving parts, and could operate with a plethora of electrolytes which can be chosen for optimal performance at specific working temperatures. Therefore, this heat-to-current converter is interesting for small-scale, domestic, and industrial applications.","4608":"Kraft black liquor, an cheap and widely available biomass by-product, has been emulsified with 1,2-dichloroethane, and then crosslinked by epichlorohydrin to prepare rigid macroporous bio-based monoliths. A subsequent thermal treatment under nitrogen of these materials produces carbon foams or carboHlPEs, with hierarchical porosity: the original macroporous structure is preserved while mesopores and micropores structuring the walls are created. Specific surface areas of 500-1000 m(2) g(-1) and micropore volumes of 0.3-0.5 cm(3) g(-1) can be obtained. In addition, after a further thermal treatment at higher temperature, these new carboHlPEs show an exceptionally high electrical conductivity over 800 S m(-1). Therefore, they may find applications in the field of energy storage.

The microplates based on uncoated cellophane are particularly interesting for applications that require high transparency in the ultraviolet (UV) regime, and offer a low-cost alternative to expensive quartz-well plates. Uncoated cellophane is also resistant to damage by various solvents. The microfluidic devices, based on coated cellophane, can have features with dimensions as small as 500 mu m, and complex, non-planar geometries. Electrodes can be printed on the surface of the coated cellophane, and embedded in microfluidic devices, to develop resistive heaters and electroanalytical devices for flow injection analysis, and continuous flow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) applications. These open-channel devices are appropriate for applications where optical transparency (especially in the visible regime), resistance to damage by water, biocompatibility and biodegradability are important. Cellophane microfluidic systems complement existing cellulose-based paper microfluidic systems, and provide an alternative to other materials used in microfluidics, such as synthetic polymers or glass. Cellulose films are plausible materials for uses in integrated microfluidic systems for diagnostics, analyses, cell-culture, and MEMS.","472":"Calixarene-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) composites were synthesized via esterification and polymerization of calix[n]arenes (n = 4, 6, 8) onto graphene oxide surfaces for the first time. The GO composites were used to adsorb Nd ions from the aqueous phase due to their quite high BET surface areas. In this work, the GO composites (GO-C4, GO-C6, and GO-C8) showed high adsorption capacities (232.56, 219.78, and 311.53 mg g(-1), respectively) compared to GO (110.99 mg g(-1)) during the removal process and excellent efficiency in removing a high concentration of neodymium ions (1150 mg L-1) from water. The results indicate that the adsorption ability for Nd ions was in the order of GO-C8 > GO-C4 > GO-C6 > GO. The adsorption processes of GO-C4 and GO-C8 were completed within 185 min, whereas that of GO-C6 was achieved within 230 min. Furthermore, controlling the pH value of an aqueous solution in the range of 6, the GO composites exhibited the highest adsorption capacity toward Nd ions. For our process of removing Nd ions, the adsorption data of experiments mostly fit the pseudo-second-order model better than two other models. Four adsorption isotherm models were compared to study the details of the adsorption process, and the results indicated that the Freundlich model is the most suitable for describing the adsorption process of the GO composites. The adsorption mechanisms to remove Nd ions were the electrostatic attraction of Nd ions with hydroxyl functional groups and the complexation process of Nd ions with functional groups on the surface of the GO composite. Moreover, thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption behavior of the GO composites towards Nd ions was an endothermic and spontaneous natural process. In general, GO composites could potentially be applied to metal ion removal.","2716":"A new liquid-crystal (LC)-based sensor operated by nickel nanosphere (NiNS)-induced homeotropic alignment for the label-free monitoring of thrombin was reported. When doped with NiNSs, a uniform vertical orientation of 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) was easily obtained. A sandwich system of aptamer\/thrombin\/aptamer-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was fabricated, and AuNPs aptamer conjugation caused the disruption of the 5CB orientation, leading to an obvious change of the optical appearance from a dark to a bright response to thrombin concentrations from 0.1 to 100 nM. This design also allowed quantitative detection of the thrombin concentration. This distinctive and sensitive thrombin LC sensor provides a new principle for building LC-sensing systems.","1670":"Microgels are colloidally stable, hydrogel microparticles that have previously been used in a range of (soft) material applications due to their tunable mechanical and chemical properties. Most commonly, thermo and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be synthesized under 'crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles have extremely low (<0.5%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of similar to 10 kPa. Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers. Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.","6063":"The present work demonstrates a biomimetic electrospun scaffold based on polyurethane (PU) and ethyl cellulose (EC), featuring uniform fibrous nanostructures and three dimensional porous networks. The relationship between processing conditions and fibrous nanostructures is established which guides the rational processing with tunable fiber diameters. Additionally, the developed scaffold template reveals biocompatibility in retention and proliferation of cardiac myoblast H9C2 cells. The high mechanical strength of the PU\/EC scaffolds enables the processing and handling of an ultrathin patch. Their elastomeric characteristics revealed the compatibility between the patch and contractile tissues. Furthermore, anisotropic PU\/EC scaffolds with aligned nanofibers were successfully fabricated, exhibiting higher mechanical strength and essential characteristics for the survival and function of cardiac cells with native anisotropy.

These nanoparticles route electrons from organic structures and electron carriers to form hydroxyl radicals within tumor cells. During visible light exposure, WO3\/Pt nanoparticles manufacture hydroxyl radicals, degrade organic compounds, use NADPH, trigger lipid peroxidation, promote lysosomal membrane disruption, promote the loss of reduced glutathione, and activate apoptosis. In a model of advanced breast cancer metastasis to the eye's anterior chamber, we show that WO3\/Pt nanoparticles prolong the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb\/c mice. This new generation of inorganic photosensitizers do not photobleach, and therefore should provide an important therapeutic advance in photodynamic therapy. As biomimetic nanoparticles destroy targeted cells, they may be useful in treating ocular and other forms of cancer.","1817":"CONSPECTUS: Owing to its high sensitivity and great applicability, the fluorescence phenomenon has been considered as an inevitable research tool in the modem scientific fields of chemistry, biology, materials science, biomedical science, and their interfaces. Many strategies have been pursued to understand and manipulate the photophysical properties of fluorescent materials, but the scientific community has been focused on the repeated application of existing organic fluorophores or the identification of unique fluorescence properties in a trial-and-error basis without systematic studies. Moreover, recent studies are emphasizing the necessity of deeper understanding about the structure photophysical property relationship of organic fluorophores for the development of better fluorescent probes. Herein, we provide an overview of a novel fluorescent molecular framework, Seoul-Fluor, which can be rationally engineered to furnish a wide variety of fluorophores in terms of the photophysical properties. Seoul-Fluor is built on an indolizine-based fluorescent platform with three different positions to introduce various substituents: R-1 and R-2 substituents for electronic perturbation; R-3 substituent as a functional handle for bioconjugation. Over the past decade, we have demonstrated that the Seoul-Fluor system has (i) tunable and predictable emission wavelength covering a full visible-color range; (ii) controllable quantum yield via photoinduced electron transfer phenomenon; and (iii) environment-sensitive fluorogenic properties that can be modified through intramolecular charge transfer processes. We convincingly demonstrated the prediction of photophysical properties, that is, emission wavelength and quantum yield, through the construction of a systematic set of analogues and the subsequent analysis of their photophysical properties without the highly sophisticated theoretical support. Guided, by quantifiable parameters such as the Hammett substituent constants or energy levels of the molecular orbitals, this unique organic fluorophore can serve as a versatile molecular platform for the development of novel fluorescent switchable biosensors and filuorogenic bioprobes. In this Account,;we will discuss the discovery and recent progress made on Seoul-Fluor, the rational design of Seoul-Fluor-based bioprobes, and their practical applications to specific biological processes that are facilitated by systematic studies of the structure photophysical property relationships.","6510":"Owing to the advantages of high surface area, good conductivity, sustainability, and chemical stability, biomass-based activated carbon materials have been one of the research hotspots in the field of supercapacitors. Yet common techniques to synthesize nanostructured electrodes of activated carbon only offer limited control on their morphology and structure. In this work, three-dimensional porous hollow microspheres of activated carbon are fabricated by utilizing various spores (Lycopodium clavatum, Ganodorma lucidum and Lycopodium annotinum spores) as carbon precursors and self-templates through a facile, green and low-cost route. The abundant and easily available carbon sources of spores allow for mass production of activated carbon microspheres (ACMs), which almost ideally inherit the distinctive nano-architectures of spores, presenting a superhigh specific surface area (up to 3053 m2 g(-1)) and hierarchical porous structure. Such ACM electrodes show remarkable electrical double-layer storage performances, such as high specific capacitance (308 F g(-1) in organic electrolytes), ultrafast rate capability (retaining 263 F g(-1) at a very high current density of 20 A g(-1)) and good cycling stability (93.8% retention after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles), thus leading to a high energy density (57 W h kg(-1)) and superior power density (17 kW kg(-1)).","6501":"The development of novel and portable chemical sensors aimed at the food industry is of prime importance for food safety issues, and nanomaterial science can greatly contribute to this task. In this context, a careful choice of the sensing material is essential for achieving high performance sensor arrays, such as those employed in nanostructured electronic tongues (e-tongues). In the current work, an impedimetric e-tongue based on gold interdigitated microelectrodes (IDEs) modified with polyamide 6\/polyaniline (PA6\/PANI) electrospun nanofibers was developed, characterized and used to detect tetracycline (TC) residue in fat and skimmed milk samples. By analyzing the electrical resistance data collected by the e-tongue, which were treated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the e-tongue was able to identify the presence of TC residues (from 1 to 300 ppb) in fat and skimmed milk samples. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the approach of modifying IDEs with conducting electrospun nanofibers to be used as sensing units in the e-tongue, aiming to analyze complex matrices such as milk without any prior pre-treatment.","4320":"PLA(2)-responsive and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle-loaded phospholipid micelles were developed.

For their peculiar behaviour as polyelectrolites, polysaccharides have been applied in various forms, such as injectable hydrogels or porous and fibrous scaffolds-alone or in combination with other natural or synthetic polymers-to design bioinspired platforms for the regeneration of different tissues (i.e., blood vessels, myocardium, heart valves, bone, articular and tracheal cartilage, intervertebral discs, menisci, skin, liver, skeletal muscle, neural tissue, urinary bladder) as well as for encapsulation and controlled delivery of drugs for pharmaceutical devices. In this paper, we focus on the pH sensitive response and degradation behaviour of negative (i.e., alginate) and positive (i.e., chitosan) charged polysaccharides in order to discuss the differences in terms of metabolic activity of polyelectrolytes with different ionic strength for their use in drug delivery and tissue engineering area.","3558":"In this work, the study of the heat transfer enhancement induced by aligning iron nanoparticles in an ethylenglicol fluid matrix is presented.

The design of advanced functional devices using hydrogels requires an in-depth understanding of the physics and behaviour of such materials.

Mesoscale modelling is an emerging approach that enables simulations of polymeric structures at length and time scales in between those of molecular dynamics and continuum methods. In this feature article, we review various computational approaches to model responsive hydrogels and specifically focus on dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), a particle-based mesoscale method.

Both challenges have been simultaneously addressed in this study by hybridizing the two nanomaterials through melt compounding to develop elastomer\/graphene platelet\/MWCNT (3-phase) composites, where MWCNTs were fixed at 2.8 vol% (5 wt%) for all fractions. We investigated the composites' structure and properties, and compared the 3-phase composites with elastomer\/graphene platelet (2-phase) composites. MWCNTs may bridge graphene platelets (GnPs) and promote their dispersion in the matrix, which would provide more interface area between the matrix and the fillers. MWCNTs worked supplementally to GnPs by forming conductive networks, where MWCNTs acted as long nanocables to transport electrons and stress while GnPs served as interconnection sites between the tubes forming local conductive paths. This produced a percolation threshold of electrical conductivity at 2.3 vol% for 3-phase composites, 88% lower than that of 2-phase composites. At 26.7 vol% of total filler content (MWCNTs + GnPs), tensile strength, Young's modulus and tear strength showed respectively 303%, 115%, 155% further improvements over those of 2-phase composites. These improvements are originated from the synergistic effect between GnPs and MWCNTs. The conducting elastomeric composites developed would potentially open the door for applications in automotive and aerospace industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The as obtained material has a form of tubes with a diameter of a couple of micrometers that are composed of carbonized cellulose coated with the polyoxoborate-AuNP nanocomposite. This inorganic shell, which covers the outer surface of the carbon microtubes, serves as a scaffold that makes the structure stable. The obtained material exhibits electrical properties of a semiconductor with the width of the band gap of about 0.6 eV, and forms Schottky contact with a metal electrode. We show that the new material is suitable for preparation of the NCT-type thermistor.

Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments showed that the prepared cathodes have less polarization and lower transfer resistance compared to gelatine binder-sulphur cathode. The prepared cathode exhibited a much higher initial and reversible capacity after 100 cycles at rates of 0.1 and 0.5 degrees C than that of gelatine bindersulphur cathode under the same condition. Our findings have shown that acylated gelatine is a promising binder to improve Li-S performance and helpful for its future development.","2404":"Developing efficient, low-cost fabrication technology is the basic requirement for large-scale commercial production of thin film solar cell.

These structures are being used for diverse applications, including energy storage, biosensing, light emission, drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis, and chemical propulsion. To increase the structural diversity of this dipeptide building block, three previously unreported analogues in which the aliphatic chain between the peptide backbone and the phenyl ring was gradually lengthened were synthesized. Each dipeptide self-assembled into unique microstructures, differing in morphology, which ranged from flat plates to long microrods to flattened microplanks. The structures were also found to possess distinctive optical properties. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography of each of the three diphenylalanine analogues presented distinctive molecular arrangements. The remarkable differences between each dipeptide in the intermolecular interactions they formed provide insight into the physicochemical mechanisms of self-assembly and, in addition, indicate the biological significance of the single methylene bridge of phenylalanine.","6950":"The development of new nanoparticles as next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) drug platforms is an active area of both chemistry and cancer research. Although numerous gadolinium (Gd) containing metallofullerenes as diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents have been reported, the metallofullerene cage surface, in most cases, consists of negatively charged carboxyl or hydroxyl groups that limit attractive forces with the cellular surface. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a positive charge will bind more efficiently to negatively charged phospholipid bilayer cellular surfaces, and will more readily undergo endocytosis. In this paper, we report the preparation of a new functionalized trimetallic nitride template endohedral metallofullerene (TNT EMF), Gd3N@C-80(OH)(x)(NH2)(y), with a cage surface bearing positively charged amino groups (-NH3+) and directly compare it with a similar carboxyl and hydroxyl functionalized derivative. This new nanoparticle was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and infrared spectroscopy. It exhibits excellent 1H MR relaxivity. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) effectively targets glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, which are known to overexpress IL-13R alpha 2. We also report that this amino-coated Gd-nanoplatform, when subsequently conjugated with interleukin-13 peptide IL-13-Gd3N@C-80(OH)(x)(NH2)(y), exhibits enhanced targeting of U-251 GBM cell lines and can be effectively delivered intravenously in an orthotopic GBM mouse model.","4503":"Hematite iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) is considered to be a prospective anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of its high theoretical capacity (1007 mAh g(-1)), nontoxicity, and low cost. However, the low electrical conductivity and large volume change during Li insertion\/extraction of alpha-Fe2O3 hinder its use in practical batteries. In this study, carbon-coated alpha-Fe2O3 nanofibers, prepared via an electrospinning method followed by a thermal treatment process, are employed as the anode material for LIBs. The as-prepared porous nanofibers with a carbon content of 12.5 wt% show improved cycling performance and rate capability. They can still deliver a high and stable capacity of 715 mAh g(-1) even at superior high current density of 1000 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles with a large Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. Such improved electrochemical performance can be assigned to their unique porous fabric structure as well as the conductive carbon coating which shorten the distance for Li ion transport, enhancing Li ion reversibility and kinetic properties. It is, therefore, demonstrated that carbon-coated alpha-Fe2O3 nanofiber prepared under optimized conditions is a promising anode material candidate for LIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To optimize the composition of liquid atorvastatin-SEDDS, solubility tests, pseudoternary phase diagrams, emulsification studies and other in vitro examinations (thermodynamic stability, droplet size and zeta potential analysis) were performed. Due to the disadvantages of liquid SEDDS (few choices for dosage forms, low stability and portability during the manufacturing process), attempts were also made to obtain solid SEDDS. Solid SEDDS were successfully obtained using the spray drying technique from two optimized liquid formulations, CF3 and OF2. Despite liquid SEDDS formulation, CF3 was characterized by lower turbidity, higher percentage transmittance and better self-emulsifying properties, and based on the in vitro dissolution study it can be concluded that better solubilization properties were exhibited by solid formulation OF2. Overall, the studies demonstrated the possibility of formulating liquid and solid SEEDS as promising carriers of atorvastatin. SEDDS, with their unique solubilization properties, provide the opportunity to deliver lipophilic drugs to the gastrointestinal tract in a solubilized state, avoiding dissolutiona restricting factor in absorption rate of BCS Class 2 drugs, including atorvastatin.","3941":"Saturation mutagenesis was performed over six residues delimiting the substrate binding pocket of a fungal laccase previously engineered in the lab. Mutant libraries were screened using sinapic acid as a model substrate, and those mutants presenting increased activity were selected for exploring the oxidation of lignin-derived phenols. The latter comprised a battery of phenolic compounds of interest due to their use as redox mediators or precursors of added-value products and their biological activity. The new laccase variants were investigated in a multi-screening assay and the structural determinants, at both the substrate and the protein level, for the oxidation of the different phenols are discussed. Laccase activity greatly varied only by changing one or two residues of the enzyme pocket. Our results suggest that once the redox potential threshold is surpassed, the contribution of the residues of the enzymatic pocket for substrate recognition and binding strongly influence the overall rate of the catalytic reaction.","1608":"Sustainable microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) aerogels are considered to be good templates for the growth of functional organic or inorganic nanoparticles. In this work, MFC aerogels with high porosity (99.9%) and low density (2.91 mg\/cm(3)) were produced by freeze-drying. Then the obtained MFC aerogels were used as templates for the synthesis of MFC\/polypyrrole (PPy)\/silver nanoparticles (Ag) hybrid aerogels by a simple dip-coating method. Our results demonstrated that the obtained hybrid aerogels maintained the attractive features of the pristine MFC aerogels, such as high porosity, low density, and high compressive stress, during the preparation process. Compared with MFC aerogels and MFC\/PPy hybrid aerogels, the MFC\/PPy\/Ag hybrid aerogels exhibited enhanced antimicrobial and electrical conductive properties due to the combination of PPy and Ag. Moreover, the electrical conductivity and compressible properties of the MFC\/PPy\/Ag hybrid aerogels led to their pressure responsive property. These features make the hybrid aerogels promising candidates for wound healing, energy storage, and pressure sensing applications.","4755":"Graphene oxide nanosheets (GONSs) with a lateral size less than 100 nm have attracted more and more attention for their wide range of potential applications, from bionanotechnology and nanobiomedicine to surfactants. However, at present GONSs are commonly prepared from graphite nanofibers or graphite nanopowders which are both expensive. Here, a timesaving, low-cost, high-yield method is proposed for preparing ultrasmall uniform GONSs with an average lateral size of similar to 30 nm, utilizing common graphite powder as the raw material in the absence of a strong acid. The obtained GONSs are able to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) effectively, and the dispersion could withstand high-speed centrifugation. Consequently, GONSs could indeed serve as a superior surfactant for the dispersion of SWCNTs, and the dispersion could be further applied in electronics, as the GONSs may be further reduced to reduced GONSs or graphene nanosheets.","4405":"A series of chiral aryl amide compounds bearing peptide pendants have been investigated as low molecular weight gelators. A mechanistic study reveals that complementary hydrogen bonding from peptide pendants is the main driving force for the formation of organogels. This new class of organogels can exhibit multi-stimuli-responsive behavior upon applying (1) thermal, (2) pH, (3) enantiomeric purity, and (4) fluoride anion stimuli. Enantiomeric purity as a new external stimulus displays sensitive stimuli-responsiveness; only 0.02 equiv. of the enantiomer can completely disassemble the gel aggregate. They will serve as excellent smart materials with potential applications in chiral sensors, recognition, and separation.","6516":"We report the design of a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on manganese monoxide\/carbon aerogel (MnO\/NCA) composites as the positive electrode and iron oxide\/carbon aerogel (Fe2O3\/NCA) composites as the negative electrode. The prepared MnO\/NCA hybrid composites display a highly interconnected network structure with ultrathin MnO nanoparticles uniformly embedded into the 3D nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Because of the synergistic effects of the highly conductive carbon aerogel and highly pseudocapacitive metal oxides, the hybrid MnO\/NCA electrode exhibits highly effective surface area, greatly enhanced ion transportation, and excellent electrochemical performance, in comparison with other MnOx-based electrode materials. Matching it with the Fe2O3\/NCA cathode, the novel ASC devices can achieve a high voltage window of 2.0 V, delivering a remarkable energy density of 48.67 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1000 W kg(-1) and still retains 27.39 W h kg(-1) at a high power density of 10 kW kg(-1), consequently giving rise to stable cycling performance. These encouraging results will provide a fresh route for the design and fabrication of metal oxide@carbon aerogel materials for application in next-generation storage systems.","4063":"The superior self-healing elastomers were readily prepared by free-radical copolymerization of methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA). The synergistic interaction between the shape memory effect and the reversible weak hydrogen bonds lead to the excellent self-healing properties and high mechanical strength of the elastomers. By taking advantage of the two outstanding performances, we demonstrated that various novel two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shape memory devices can be precisely designed on the basis of the self-healing mediated assembly of the elastomers as building blocks. This assembly method to combine self-healing and shape memory properties might open up a promising avenue for the design and fabrication of 3D complex-shape smart devices.","7411":"Natural white light emission from a single component, a novel strontium(II)-based metal-organic framework, {[Sr(ntca)(H2O)(2)].H2O}(n) (1) was achieved. Compound 1 exhibited a remarkable continuous broadband emission with the highest sensitivity at around 550 nm, making it more physically comfortable for the human eye. The continuous spectrum of compound 1 also closely resembles the sunlight spectrum with a CCT of 5451 K, producing a natural white light. An alkaline earth metal (Sr) is used as the metal node in the preparation of the compound which is more environmentally friendly as compared with commonly used lanthanides in luminescent materials. This natural white light emitter with a pleasant effect on human visibility, and without any doping of lanthanide promises to open up new perspectives for the development of high-performance solid-state lighting sources.","5678":"Infested ash tree residues were carbonized at 600, 700 and 900 A degrees C. The carbonization product-biochar (BC) was investigated as a potential active material for supercapacitor electrodes in its original (o-BC) and activated (a-BC) forms. The electrodes were formed with o-BC or a-BC and a water based composite binder. The correlation between the physical properties of BC and electrochemical properties of these electrodes were carefully investigated in H2SO4 and aqueous LiN(SO2CF3)(2) electrolytes. The results obtained from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry and charge\/discharge measurements showed approximately a tenfold increase in the capacitance of the electrodes with the a-BC. Further analysis of the BC samples identified functional groups on the carbon surface of the a-BC which could be responsible for such a dramatic increase in the performance of the electrodes. The highest specific capacitances of 470 F g(-1) in 0.75 M H2SO4 and 335 F g(-1) in 3 M LiN(SO2CF3)(2) were achieved. The cycle life of electrodes with a-BC in LiN(SO2CF3)(2) electrolyte is stable and shows a very insignificant decrease in capacitive performance after 1500 cycles. These results indicate that the BC derived from infested ash trees is a promising material for use in supercapacitor electrodes.","3142":"The question how G-protein-coupled receptors transduce an extracellular signal by a sequence of transmembrane conformational transitions into an intracellular response remains to be solved at molecular detail. Herein, we use molecular dynamics simulations to reveal distinct conformational transitions of the adenosine A(2A) receptor, and we found that the conserved W246(6.48) residue in transmembrane helix TM6 performs a key rotamer toggle switch. Agonist binding induces the sidechain of W246(6.48) to fluctuate between two distinct conformations enabling the diffusion of water molecules from the bulk into the center of the receptor. After passing the W246(6.48) gate, the internal water molecules induce another conserved residue, Y288(7.53), to switch to a distinct rotamer conformation establishing a continuous transmembrane water pathway. Further, structural changes of TM6 and TM7 induce local structural changes of the adjacent lipid bilayer.","5471":"The application of conventional nanostructure carbon-based materials (such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction always suffers from inferior conductivity and low surface area because both graphene and CNTs easily aggregate to form networks with many boundaries. Here, to solve those problems, we have rationally developed \"carbon nanoleaf\" networks for the oxygen reduction reaction of fuel cells. The \"carbon nanoleaf\" networks are constructed as aerogels with nitrogen-doped CNTs bridged with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) by using CNTs as a single precursor. In these carbon nanoleaves, large amounts of unzipped nanoscale GNRs tightly attach to the intact inner walls of the CNTs and thus allow intrinsically good electrical contact. Self-assembly of the carbon nanoleaves into three-dimensional porous aerogel networks with large surface areas guarantees the ultrafast and sufficient mass transfer in the catalytic process. Moreover, the \" carbon nanoleaf\" networks restrain the aggregation of adjacent CNTs or GNRs, which is inevitable in other 3D CNT and\/or graphene nanosheet\/GNR networks, to reduce the possibility of the formation of boundaries. Accordingly, the prepared 3D carbon nanoleaf architectures possess a large surface area (380-497 m(2) g(-1)) and an excellent conductivity (up to 112 S m(-1)), much higher than those of other reported 3D carbon-based architectures. The \" carbon nanoleaf\" networks can thus act as newly developed oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts with a positive onset potential, ultra-low hydrogen peroxide production and excellent durability that are comparable to or better than those of commercial Pt\/C catalysts both in alkaline and acidic solutions.","7069":"As one of the most common toxins of the toxigenic Cyanobacteria, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) has raised global concerns in water monitoring, environmental detection, toxicology research and epidemiology research. In this work, a portable electrochemical MC-LR immunosensor was fabricated for the detection of MC-LR. Firstly, graphene hydrogel@polydopamine (GH@PDA) was prepared by self-polymerization of dopamine on graphene oxide, followed by a hydrothermal reaction. The modification of polydopamine (PDA) not only acts as an important modifier of the inner structure of the hydrogel, but can also prevent graphene aggregation during further treatments. The transformation to GH@PDA by the hydrothermal reaction was a green synthesis, and this process can be also used to capture biomolecules based on nucleophilic reactions or Schiff base reactions between the catechol groups of PDA and the amino groups of antigens. Secondly, mesoporous carbon spheres, which were loaded with thionine as the electron mediator followed by captured Au nanoparticles, were used to immobilize horseradish peroxidase and secondary antibodies, providing a strong electrochemical response. Using this dual-amplification strategy, the immunosensor can detect MC-LR as a competitive method in the range from 0.01 to 10 mu g L-1, with a detection limit of 0.0097 mg L-1. This method also showed good accuracy, acceptable precision and reproducibility. The proposed strategy provides biocompatible immobilization and sensitive recognition for the detection of chemical compounds, pollutants and food contaminants and for clinical diagnosis.","3159":"Lignin separation two-step pretreatment methods were investigated using waste corn stover. The impact of this method on enzymatic hydrolysis of sugar production was examined. Single factor experiment and orthogonal design methods were applied to study the effect of the concentration of NaOH solution, the processing time on the treatment effect. The results show that in the lignin separation two-step pretreatment, the highest cellulose digestibility of corn stover was 84.5% (Step 1 with the condition of 1 wt.% NaOH, 70 wt.% ethanol solution, 70 degrees C and 3 h; Step 2 with the condition of 140 degrees C and 30 min).","318":"A tetraphenylethene-containing fluorescent macromolecular benzoxazine derivative (TPE-BOZ) was synthesized via the Mannich reaction under catalyst -free conditions using 4,4'-(1,2-diphenylethene-1,2diyl)diphenol, poly(propylene glycol)-bis-(2-aminopropylether) and formaldehyde as the starting materials. TPE-BOZ displayed typical aggregation -induced emission enhancement characteristics in ethanol (a good solvent) and water (a poor solvent), which stemmed from the incorporation of tetraphenylethene moieties into its structure. The fluorescence of TPE-BOZ in a high water fraction medium (ethanol : water 1 : 9 v\/v) was effectively quenched by the introduction of picric acid with a Stern-Volmer value (ks) of 1.134 x 107 M-1. The detection limit for picric acid by TPE-BOZ was 4.47 nM. The presence of other common nitrocompounds and solvent residuals did not significantly interfere with the recognition of picric acid by TPE-BOZ. TPE-BOZ can also be used as a solid-state probe to determine picric acid.","5002":"V2O5 nanowires decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles are prepared by two-step mild hydrothermal reaction, and the gas sensor device is fabricated by coating the nanowires as a thick film on the alumina tube. The pure V2O5 nanowires have almost no response to ethanol at room temperature, however, the sensitivity of V2O5 nanowires decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles is 1.46 upon exposure to 1000 ppm ethanol gas. The highest sensitivity of gas sensor based on V2O5 nanowires decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles to 1000 ppm ethanol is about 14, which is 2-3 times of pure V2O5 nanowires. The improved sensing performance of the composite is due to the increased depletion width and active sites along the nanowires, the energy gap between V2O5 nanowires and SnO2 nanoparticles promotes the electrons transport. Moreover, the gas sensor based on V2O5 nanowires decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles possesses a good selectivity to ethanol compared with other gases, such as CO2, H2O and NH3, and the stability of gas sensing performance is quite good, which implies that it would be a good candidate in the potential application.","1168":"Materials which induce molecular motion without external input offer unique opportunities for spatial manipulation of molecules. Here, we present the use of polyacrylamide hydrogel films containing built-in chemical gradients (enthalpic gradients) to direct molecular transport. Using a cationic tertiary amine gradient, anionic molecules were directionally transported up to several millimeters. A 40-fold concentration of anionic molecules dosed in aerosol form on a substrate to a small region at the center of a radially symmetric cationic gradient was observed. The separation of mixtures of charged dye molecules was demonstrated using a boronic acid-to-cationic gradient where one molecule was attracted to the boronic acid end of the gradient, and the other to the cationic end of the gradient. Theoretical and computational analysis provides a quantitative description of such anisotropic molecular transport, and reveals that the gradient-imposed drift velocity is in the range of hundreds of nanometers per second, comparable to the transport velocities of biomolecular motors. This general concept of enthalpy gradient-directed molecular transport should enable the autonomous processing of a diversity of chemical species.","3505":"Hyaluronidase (HAase) is becoming a new type of tumor marker since it has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in various kinds of cancer cells. In this study, we described a novel fluorescence method for sensitive, rapid, and convenient HAase detection and tumor-targeting drug delivery and imaging, using a probe prepared by electrostatic assembly of a cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) and anionic hyaluronan (HA) conjugated with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox). The CCP we used was poly{[9,9-bis(6'-(N,N,N-diethylmethylammonium)hexyl)-2,7-fluorenylene ethynylene]-alt-co-[2,5-bis(3'-(N,N,N-diethylmethylammonium)-1'-oxapropyl)-1,4-phenylene]} tetraiodide (PFEP). HA is a natural mucopolysaccharide that can be hydrolyzed by HAase into fragments with low molecular weights. In the PFEP\/HA-Dox complex, the fluorescence of PFEP was efficiently quenched due to electron transfer from PFEP to Dox. After the PFEP\/HA-Dox complex was exposed to HAase or was taken up by cancer cells through the specific binding between HA and CD44 receptor, HA was degraded by HAase to release the Dox, leading to the recovery of PFEP fluorescence to the \"turn-on\" state. Moreover, the degree of fluorescence recovery was quantitatively correlated with the concentrations of HAase. Compared with many previously reported methods, our work did not require laborious multiple modifications of HA that may affect the activity of HAase. This point, combined with the excellent optoelectronic property of conjugated polymer, endowed this method with high sensitivity (detection limit: 0.075 U\/mL), high specificity, and rapid response, making it applicable for reliable and routine detection of HAase. This fluorescent probe was successfully utilized to detect HAase levels in human urine samples; furthermore, it can also be employed as a multifunctional system by realizing tumor-targeting drug delivery and cell imaging simultaneously. The development of this fluorescence method showed promising potential for early tumor diagnosis and therapy based on HAase detection.","5357":"BACKGROUNDCellulose as a renewable biomaterial has forced attention on the use of cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes for industrial bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to glucose. This paper reports immobilization of cross-linked cellulase aggregates (CLEA) on the amine-functionalized Fe3O4@silica core-shell magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). RESULTSThe optimum pH of the cellulase cocktail upon immobilization (cellulase CLEA-MNP) shifted a little to the acidic side whereas the optimum temperature did not change significantly. The behavior of CMCase activity in the cellulase CLEA-MNP at pH and temperature values higher than the optimum was significantly different compared with free cellulase. Cellulase CLEA-MNP retained about 45% of its maximum activity at pH values higher than 4.8, while free cellulase lost its activity sharply. Immobilized cellulase in contrast to the free form retained about 65% of its maximum activity at 80 degrees C. Cellulase CLEA-MNP had improved thermal stability at 65 degrees C. Operational stability of the immobilized cellulase was also noticeable. After a sharp decrease during two cycles of CMC hydrolysis, cellulase CLEA-MNP retained 30% of its initial activity through six cycles of reuse. CONCLUSIONSimple separation of MNPs from reaction medium and durability of CLEA-MNP composite during repeated use may overcome the major bottleneck against comprehensive applications of cellulase enzymes in industry.

Intermediate 4 was obtained from one-pot reaction of ethyl acetoacetate, phenylhydrazine, and N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) followed by reaction with hydrazine hydrate and carbon disulfide. The structure of the newly synthesized compounds was established on the basis of elemental analysis, infrared (IR), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), C-13 NMR, and mass spectroscopic data. All synthesized compounds were screened for in vivo antiinflammatory, in vivo analgesic, and in vitro antimicrobial activity. From the activity studies, it was concluded that, among all the derivatives, compounds 5c, 5e, 5f, 6c, 7b, and 7c showed potent antiinflammatory activity, whereas 5b, 5c, 5e, 5f, 6c, 6f, 7b, 7c, and 7e exhibited good analgesic activity. Compounds 6a, 6c, 7b, 7c, and 7d showed maximum activity against the bacterial strains. Efforts were also made to establish structure-activity relationships among the tested compounds.","5338":"Most developing countries have an urgent need to construct and build houses that are more durable at a low cost. The compressed earth block (CEB) has been identified as a low-cost material with the potential to redress the problem and reverse the shelter backlog. While its properties, using cement and lime, are well understood, the use of vegetal fibers with chemical stabilizers still raises a lot of questions. The principal objective of this research is to investigate the mechanical and physical properties of CEB stabilized with quicklime and filled with date palm fibers. The fibers have been chemically treated using an alkaline solution to enhance the fiber\/matrix bonding consequently increases the mechanical strength. In this work, the effect of curing methods and curing time on mechanical strength of CEB was studied. The investigation results indicate that, although the strengths values of CEB filled with alkali treated fibers is slightly greater than that with untreated fibers, the fiber surface treatment did not result in an improvement in the fiber\/matrix adhesion, leading to a decrease in strength of the blocks. The research findings show that the use of date palm fibers lead to a reduction in thermal conductivity and bulk density and increases the capillary absorption of the blocks. An adverse effect on thermal conductivity of CEB with alkali treated date palm fibers was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The reduced graphene oxide sheets form an integrated three-dimensional network to accommodate GNPs, while the GNPs act as reinforcements to avoid excessive volume shrinkage of the network during the air drying process. Octadecanol is thus easily impregnated into the porous graphene network to obtain octadecanol\/graphene phase change composites (PCCs) with exceptional thermal conductivities. The PCC with 12 wt% graphene exhibits a thermal conductivity of similar to 5.92 W m(-1) K-1 that is 26-fold higher than that of neat 1-octadecanol while maintaining a high latent heat of fusion (similar to 202.8 J g(-1)). Even when compressed by a high weight at similar to 70 degrees C, the PCC still retains shape stability without any leakage. Such abilities to endow PCCs with exceptional shape stability and to boost their thermal conductivity by an order-of-magnitude without incurring a significant loss in the heat of fusion are important attributes in enabling their practical application as latent heat storage\/release units for thermal management and thermal protection.","7247":"By using two separate components, mem-sensing devices can be fabricated combining the sensitivity of a transducer with non-volatile memory. Here, we discuss how a mem-sensor can be fabricated using a single material with built-in sensing andmemory capabilities, based on ZnO microwires (MWs) embedded in a photocurable resin and processed from liquid by vertically aligning the MWs across the polymeric matrix using dielectrophoresis. This results in an ultraviolet (UV) photodetector, a device that is widely applied in fields such as telecommunication, health, and defense, and has so far implemented using bulk inorganic semiconductors. However, inorganic detectors suffer from very high production costs, brittleness, huge equipment requirements, and low responsivity. Here, we propose for the first time aneasy processable, reproducible, and low-cost hybrid UV mem-sensor. Composites with aligned ZnO MWs produce giant photocurrentscompared to the same composites with randomly distributed MWs. In particular, we efficiently exploit a mem-response where the photocurrent carries memory of the last electronic state experienced by the device when under testing. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-equivalence of different wave profiles used during thedielectrophoresis: a pulsed wave is able to induce order in both the axis and the orientation of the MWs, whereas a sine wave only affects the orientation.","7398":"This study is focused on development of functionalized inorganic-organic nanofibrousmaterial with antibacterial activity for wound dressing applications. The nanofibers combining poly(vinyl alcohol) and silica were produced by electrospinning from the sol and thermally stabilized. ThePVA\/silica nanofibers surface was functionalized by silver and copper nanoparticles to ensure antibacterial activity. It was proven that quantity of adsorbed silver and copper nanoparticles depends on process time of adsorption. According to antibacterial tests results, this novel nanofibrousmaterial shows a big potential for wound dressing applications due to its significant antibacterial efficiency.","6050":"We have designed and prepared three pseudopeptide foldamers, called dyads 1, 2 and 3, equipped with a donor and an acceptor unit to promote intramolecular electron transfer after light excitation. All the three dyads contain the same donor and acceptor, which are a derivative of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and a derivative of pyromellitic diimide, respectively. The donor and acceptor units are separated by hybrid foldamers of different length in order to vary both their distance and relative orientation. Specifically, one, two or three L-Ala-D-Oxd (Ala = alanine, Oxd = 4-carboxy-5-methyl-oxazolidin-2-one) units are contained in dyads 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Dyad 1 folds in a bent conformation in which the donor and acceptor units lie one close to the other, while dyads 2 and 3 preferentially assume an extended conformation. In all the three dyads both the donor and acceptor emissions are efficiently quenched via intramolecular electron transfer, as suggested by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. Because of its bent conformation dyad 1 exhibits a charge-transfer (CT) band at 410 nm in CH2Cl2 solution and a photoinduced electron transfer that occurs more efficiently than in dyads 2 and 3. Upon dissolving dyad 1 in DMSO, a competitive solvent for hydrogen bonds that establish in the pseudopeptide linker, the CT band disappears and the efficiency of electron transfer slightly decreases, in agreement with an unfolded conformation in which donor and acceptor units are no longer in close contact.","4758":"A flexible gas sensor operating at low temperature was achieved using TiO2 membrane nanotubes prepared by anodization method. The TiO2 membrane nanotubes have an average diameter of 100 nm with a length of 12 mu m. TiO2 membrane nanotubes was supported over a flexible substrate, onto which array interdigitated gold electrodes were obtained using conventional microfabrication procedure. The sensing characteristics were investigated by measuring the electrical resistance of the sensor in a test chamber as a function of gas concentration. This was used to detect trimethylamine (TMA) within a concentration range of 40-400 ppm. The experiment results show that the TiO2 membrane nanotubes are a kind of promising material for detecting TMA at low temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A facet-selective-catalytic process was thus proposed to synthesize polymer-linked carbon nanostructures with different shapes, covering straight carbon nanofiber, carbon nano Y-junction, carbon nano-hexapus, and carbon nano-octopus. A thermal chemical vapor deposition process was applied to grow these multi-branched carbon nanostructures at temperatures lower than 350 degrees C. Cu nanoparticles were utilized as the catalyst and acetylene as the reaction gas. The growth of those multi-branched nanostructures was realized through the selective growth of polymer-like sheets on certain indexed facets of Cu catalyst. The vapor-facet-solid (VFS) mechanism, a new growth mode, has been proposed to interpret such a growth in the steps of formation, diffusion, and coupling of carbon-containing oligomers, as well as their final precipitation to form nanostructures on the selective Cu facets.","866":"We report a facile method to fabricate reduced graphene oxide\/polypyrrole hydrogels (rGO\/PPy) simply by combining the self-assembly process at room temperature with oxidation polymerization at elevated temperature.

In particular, 82% of the capacitance value has been maintained after charge-discharge for 5000 cycles, suggesting the great potential applications of the rGO\/PPy hydrogels in high-quality energy storage devices.

These nanorods are grown in the direction normal to the sodium-ion tunnels, greatly shortening the diffusion distance of sodium ions and benefiting the transfer kinetics. Thus, the nanorods show significant enhancements in terms of reversible capacity, cycling stability and rate capability.

The chemical structure and composition characterizations of the cotton fabric were carried out using corresponding characterization techniques, which indicated that, in the process of in situ polymerization, the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose, to a certain extent, could also be involved in the reaction and confirmed that the hydrophobicity of treated cotton (with a maximal contact angle of approximately 124 degrees) was a result of the synergetic effect of low surface energy of PFOS and the coexistence of micro\/nano structures on the cotton surface. The results of cyclic voltammetry, fiber resistance testing, and thermal analyses proved that the electro-optical properties and thermal stability of cotton fabric were drastically enhanced by PFOS-doped PANI. Utilizing the doping\/dedoping process of PANI, the wettability of treated cotton underwent a reversible change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Color tests and zeta potential measurements served as auxiliary evidence to explain the mechanism of the wettability switch of the functionalized cotton. The stability of PFOS-doped PANI on the cotton surface was evaluated by a washing fastness test, which showed that the contact angle of the treated cotton could still reach 94.5 degrees after 25 cycles of water washing.","1335":"The increasing frequency of multi-drug resistant microorganisms has driven research into alternative therapeutic strategies. In this respect, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold much promise as candidates for the development of novel antibiotics. However, AMPs have some intrinsic drawbacks, such as partial degradation by host proteases or inhibition by host body fluid composition, potential toxicity, and high production costs. This review focuses on the hepcidins, which are peptides produced by the human liver with a known role in iron homeostasis, as well by numerous other organisms (including fish, reptiles, other mammals), and their potential as antibacterial and antifungal agents. Interestingly, the antimicrobial properties of human hepcidins are enhanced at acidic pH, rendering these peptides appealing for the design of new drugs targeting infections that occur in body areas with acidic physiological pH. This review not only considers current research on the direct killing activity of these peptides, but evaluates the potential application of these molecules as coating agents preventing biofilm formation and critically assesses technical obstacles preventing their therapeutic application.","5022":"The present paper reports on the preparation of novel iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanotube@hollow carbon fibers (denoted as Fe\/N\/CNT@PCFs) by pyrolysis of the natural product catkin, FeCl3 and melamine. The experimental results show that: (1) melamine and FeCl3 doped into precursors have hugely enhanced the content of doped nitrogen in Fe\/N\/CNT@PCFs; (2) Fe elements have catalyzed the growth of abundant CNTs along both the inner and outer walls of Fe\/N\/CNT@PCFs affording abundant porous structures and a larger BET specific surface area; (3) Fe elements have also facilitated the transformation of inactive oxidized N species to the highly active pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and Fe-N clusters for Fe\/N\/CNT@PCFs, thereby improving the ORR electro-catalytic activity of the as-prepared Fe\/N\/CNT@PCF catalyst. On the other hand, the typical RDE and RRDE detection results have proved that the ORR catalyzed by the as-prepared Fe\/N\/CNT@PCF catalyst is mainly by 4e(-) reduction accompanying higher durability of the ORR electro-catalytic activity and more excellent methanol tolerance compared with the commercial Pt\/C catalyst. The relatively simple synthesis approach, the cheap precursor materials, and excellent ORR catalytic efficiency of the Fe\/N\/CNT@PCF catalyst make it promising for low-temperature fuel cells.","2168":"Smart textiles have progressed well beyond the laboratory stage. A growing community of smart textile designers utilises engineered materials and advanced manufacturing technologies to create marketable products. To implement an environmentally conscious way of product innovation, the environmental impact of such products needs to be taken into account already at the early design-stages. A life-cycle perspective on the consequences of design choices can guide the implementation of eco-design measures. However, not much literature is available thus far to empower designers in making sustainable design decisions. To meet this need, this article presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a wearable smart textile device for ambulant medical therapy. The case study focuses on material selection, since this aspect is one of the most relevant choices at the prototyping stage. The eco-cost approach was used to compare the LCA-results of the original prototype design against various eco-redesign options. The results suggest several priority areas for environmental improvement. One possibility is the replacement of silver based conductive yarns by copper based alternatives. Another finding suggests the use of acryl instead of wool. The case study results are the starting point for further discussion on the role of designers with respect to responsible eco-design.

The Bi2O3 QDs with a size of 5-15 nm are well dispersed on the surface of the BiVO4 nanofibers with a diameter of 400-700 nm to form a Bi2O3 QD-decorated BiVO4 nanofiber photocatalyst. Based on the phase separation mechanism and the properties of solvents, a possible formation process of the Bi2O3 QD-decorated BiVO4 nanofibers has been proposed. The BiVO4 nanofibers decorated with Bi2O3 QDs exhibit much better photocatalytic performance than pure BiVO4 nanofibers. Photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectra prove that decorating BiVO4 nanofibers with very small Bi2O3 QDs can effectively promote the separation of photoinduced carriers, which is beneficial for photocatalytic properties. More significantly, this work is relevant to environmental purification and photoelectrochemistry.","1539":"This study aims to develop an aqueous zinc\/electrospun poly(5-cyanoindole) fibers secondary battery system. Zn foil and ZnCl2 are used as anode active materials and the electrolytic solution, respectively. Poly(5-cyanoindole) synthesized by chemical oxidation is electrospun into fibers and used as cathode active materials. FTIR and NMR test are carried out to investigate the chemical structure of poly(5-cyanoindole). Surface properties of electrospun poly(5-cyanoindole) fibers are studied by SEM, TEM, and BET. The performance of zinc\/electrospun poly(5-cyanoindole) fibers battery system is evaluated in term of electrical conductivity, cyclic voltammogram, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, discharge capacity and durability test. The cell achieves 2.0 V electromotive force with about 107 -61 Ah Kg(-1) discharge capacity at 0.2C-10C rate. At 800th cycle, the discharge capacity remains 80 -57 Ah Kg(-1) at 0.2C-2C rate, which is about 75-63% of the maximum discharge capacity. These results indicate that the cell has very excellent cyclic properties as well as fast charge\/discharge properties. Electrospun poly(5-cyanoindole) fibers have been proved to be a better candidate than polyindole powder as cathode material in zinc\/polymer battery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The attention is focused on the temperature of the thermal decomposition, the nature of organic solvent, heating rate and the mode of the heating. In particular, heating on Wood alloy with simultaneous bubbling of argon through the reaction mixture versus the heating on mantel with magnetic stirring is highlighted as a route to improve the monodispersity of the nanoparticles. The effect of heating mode and rate on the nanoparticles size is estimated. The obtained tendencies point to the heating mode and rate as additional factors affecting the kinetic separation between nucleation and nanoparticle growth processes.","3552":"Membrane fusion events are essential to cell biology, and a number of reductionist systems have been developed to mimic the behavior of these biological motifs. One such system monitors the DNA hybridization-mediated fusion of liposomes with the liquid crystal (LC) interface by observing changes in LC orientation using a simple optical detection scheme. We have systematically explored key parameters of this system to determine their effects on individual elementary steps of the complex fusion mechanism. The liposome composition, specifically the degree of lipid unsaturation and PE content, decreased the bilayer rigidity, thereby increasing the rate of vesicle rupture under the stress applied by DNA hybridization. In contrast, the presence of cholesterol had the opposite effect on the mechanical properties of the bilayer, and hence of the membrane fusion rates. The accessibility of receptor moieties (i.e., complementary DNA oligonucleotides) affected the fusion kinetics by modulating the rate of hybridization events. DNA accessibility was controlled by systematic variation of the length of the DNA receptor molecules and the thickness of the steric barrier comprised of adsorbed PEGylated lipids. These results provide design rules for understanding the trade-offs between response kinetics and other important system properties, such as nonspecific adsorption. Moreover, these findings improve our understanding of the biophysical properties of membrane fusion, an important process in both natural and model systems used for bioassay and bioimaging applications.","7009":"Manganese oxides are promising pseudocapacitve materials for achieving both high power and energy densities in pseudo capacitors. However, it remains a great challenge to develop MnO2-based high-performance electrodes due to their low electrical conductance and poor stability. Here we show that MnO2 nanowires anchored on electrochemically modified graphite foil (EMGF) have a high areal capacitance of 167 mF cm(-2) at a discharge current density of 0.2 mA cm(-2) and a high capacitance retention after 5000 charge\/discharge cycles (115%), which are among the best values reported for any MnO2-based hybrid structures. The EMGF support can also be recycled and the newly deposited MnO2-based hybrids retain similarly high performance. These results demonstrate the successful preparation of pseudocapacitors with high capacity and cycling stability, which may open a new opportunity towards a sustainable and environmentally friendly method of utilizing electrochemical energy storage devices.","2812":"A green and efficient strategy for the hydrolysis of cellulose was developed by using a magnetic lignin-derived solid acid catalyst (MLC-SO3H) in the presence of ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl). The results indicated that reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading and water content have a big influence on the yield of total reducing sugars (TRS). By optimizing these reaction parameters, 69.3% TRS yield was observed at 140 A degrees C for 150 min with the addition of 40 wt% MLC-SO3H and 1 wt% water. More importantly, MLC-SO3H could be easily separated from the reaction mixture with an external magnet and could be repeatedly used five times without an obvious loss of catalytic activity, demonstrating that it possessed excellent recyclability. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism involving three consecutive processes of dissolution, adsorption and catalysis for the hydrolysis of cellulose in [BMIM]Cl over a catalyst of MLC-SO3H was also proposed.","835":"The coupling effect between piezoelectric polarization and electrochemical processes makes possible the engineering of charge-carrier conduction characteristics at the heterojunction between a strained piezoelectric material and a chemical solution. It is a unique subcategory of piezotronics. This mini review paper introduces the fundamental principles of such coupling effects. Applications of this coupling effect are reviewed and discussed in several different aspects, including selective etching enabled by piezo(ferro)-electric polarization; selective (photo)electrochemical deposition directed by piezo(ferro)-electric potential; and the direct utilization of piezoelectric potential to drive electrochemical reactions (piezocatalysis). At the end, perspectives of this coupling effect are discussed as a new approach in the fields of corrosion management, nanomanufacturing and renewable energy conversion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we have synthesized a PEM based biopolymer functionalized with silica modified GO and PVA. GO has been modified in two steps to synthesize silica grafted sulfonated GO. The functionalization of chitosan has been performed using 1,3-propane sultone after deacetylation. Furthermore, PVA has been used as a polymer matrix because PVA possesses good film forming property with mechanical stability. Different weight% (1, 2 and 5) of modified GO has been incorporated into the chitosan matrix. The prepared PEMs have been subjected to different types of characterization such as structural, thermal, mechanical and electrochemical characterization. The nano-hybrid membranes show significant increment in electrochemical properties. MGO-SCH-5 membrane shows a proton conductivity of 6.77 x 10(-2) S cm(-1), which increases to 11.2 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 90 degrees C. The thermal and mechanical stability of PEM also increases with MGO content in the sulfonated chitosan. The elastic modulus for the MGO-SCH-5 membrane is calculated to be 21.37 MPa with 54 MPa of maximum stress. Thus, these membranes may be targeted as PEMs for higher temperature energy applications.","1022":"This paper proposes the use of ultimate moisture buffering value (UMBV) for characterization of composite materials. The evaluation of mortars includes a series of experimental methods assessing the microstructure, adsorption\/desorption performance, thermal conductivity, moisture buffering value (MBV), damp condensation on surfaces and the mouldy response of mortar. In this study, common cement mortar (CM) and WSE (wood fibre, sepiolite and expanded perlite)-based mortar (WM), are moulded as a set of contrastive specimens for these tests. The results show that the adsorption of mortar is related to the performance of raw materials and internal pore structure of mortar, thermal conductivity can be influenced by moisture content of the mortar, materials with high water adsorbing capacity is liable to damp and mildew, and 20 mm is the effective thickness to indoor plastering of mortar. Adsorption, moisture proofing and desorption capacity were tested separately to evaluate UMBV of specimens. According to the tested values of these indoor walling materials, the mortar materials were classified into five grades: Ideal, Friendly, Good (but easily infested with moulds), Moderate and Inoperative. UMBV provides a comprehensive hygroscopic characterization of mortars responses to environmental conditions in realistic indoor application of these materials in sub-tropics. The evaluation method of UMBV for porous mortars can play a guiding function in setting boundary conditions of indoor humidity environmental simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The microgripper uses different 'stick-slip' and 'rolling' locomotion in 2D and also levitation in 3D by magnetic gradient-based pulling force. This enables the microrobot to precisely manipulate each microgel by controlling its position and orientation in all x-y-z directions. Our microrobotic assembly method broke the barrier of limitation on the number of assembled microgel layers, because it enabled precise 3D levitation of the microgripper. We used the gripper to assemble microgels that had been coded with different colours and shapes onto prefabricated polymeric microposts. This eliminates the need for extra secondary cross-linking to fix the final construct. We demonstrated assembly of microgels on a single micropost up to ten layers. By increasing the number and changing the distribution of the posts, complex heterogeneous microsystems were possible to construct in 3D.","5362":"Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neurohormone exerting protective function during various stress conditions either in mature or developing tissues. Previously we proved the presence of PACAP signaling elements in chicken limb bud-derived chondrogenic cells in micromass cell cultures. Since no data can be found if PACAP signaling is playing any role during mechanical stress in any tissues, we aimed to investigate its contribution in mechanotransduction during chondrogenesis. Expressions of the mRNAs of PACAP and its major receptor, PAC1 increased, while that of other receptors, VPAC1, VPAC2 decreased upon mechanical stimulus. Mechanical load enhanced the expression of collagen type X, a marker of hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and PACAP addition attenuated this elevation. Moreover, exogenous PACAP also prevented the mechanical load evoked activation of hedgehog signaling: protein levels of Sonic and Indian Hedgehogs and Gli1 transcription factor were lowered while expressions of Gli2 and Gli3 were elevated by PACAP application during mechanical load. Our results suggest that mechanical load activates PACAP signaling and exogenous PACAP acts against the hypertrophy inducing effect of mechanical load.","3612":"Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are polymerized in the presence of a template molecule. After removing the template, the polymer scaffold can selectively rebind the template. The imprinting factor (IF) refers to the rebinding ratio of imprinted and non-imprinted polymers. Generally, the IFs of most reported MIPs are quite low (e.g. below 3.0). This is partially attributable to strong non-specific interactions. In this study, imprinted nanogels are prepared using two common dyes as templates, sulforhodamine B (SRhB) and fluorescein. By varying the buffer pH, non-specific electronic interactions between the template and the gels are reduced, leading to improved IF for the SRhB-MIPs from 1.5 (at pH 7.2) to 7.4 (at pH 9.0). At the same time, the binding capacity of the MIP remained similar. On the other hand, while pH tuning also improved the IF of the fluorescein-imprinted nanogels, the binding capacity dropped significantly. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the SRhB-imprinted nanogels display a much higher affinity (K-a = 2.9 x 10(4) M-1) than the non-imprinted (K-a = 0.031 x 10(4) M-1) when rebinding is conducted in high pH (pH 9.0). This difference is mainly driven by enthalpy. This study suggests that pH tuning can be used to further improve MIPs.","7076":"The present work aims to prepare mesoporous hydroxylapatite\/activated carbon (meso-HA\/AC) bead-onstring nanofibers and evaluate their sorption towards Co(II) via sorption kinetics and isotherms. Using polyvinyl alcohol\/hydroxylapatite\/glucose electrospun nanofibers as the precursor, meso-HA\/AC nanofibers are prepared by a hydrothermal process. The nanofibers show bead-on-string structures with mesoporous characteristics, main pores around 29 nm in size, and a specific surface area of 30.014 m(2) g(-1). Moreover, the rod-like HA crystals assemble into bundles and insert into the two neighboring activated carbon beads. The sorption of Co(II) onto meso-HA\/AC nanofibers is strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength. The pseudo-second-order model is valid to describe the sorption of Co(II) onto meso-HA\/AC nanofibers, and the intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate-controlling step. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models can well describe the sorption isotherms, and the Langmuir model is slightly better than the Freundlich model. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters imply that the sorption process is spontaneous and endothermic. The meso-HA\/AC bead-on-string nanofibers may have potential as a highly effective material for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution.","5015":"We propose a visual volumetric sensor with 5,6-dicarboxylic fluorescein cross-linked amine-functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel. The sensor undergoes volume response to Cu2+ ions at the mu M level, which enables naked-eye quantitative detection by reading the graduation on a pipette.","733":"Selective desorption of (6,5) single-wall carbon nanotubes from hydrogels only occurs at specific co-surfactant ratios. High-purity fractions are obtained at this ratio even with long elution times and different total co-surfactant concentrations. These results suggest that each (n,m) type forms a thermodynamically-stable surfactant structure in the co-surfactant solution, enabling high-fidelity separations in a single column.","1665":"Carbon nanotube spaced graphene aerogels have been prepared by a hydrothermal method and used for supercapacitor applications. The specific surface area and specific capacitance can be controlled by tuning the amount of added carbon nanotubes. The as-prepared composite aerogels retain the advantage of aerogel structure in providing macropores to ensure electrodes fast wetted by the electrolyte ions and also possess additional mesopores created by the carbon nanotube spacers for more ion adsorption. Benefited from that, the composite aerogels exhibit significantly enhanced supercapacitor properties in both aqueous and ionic liquid electrolyte. Compared with graphene aerogels, the composite aerogels show a 37% larger specific capacitance of 245.5 F g(-1) at a current density of 2.5 A g(-1) and high rate capability of 197.0 F g(-1) at a high current density of 80 A g(-1) in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the composite aerogels deliver a 33% larger specific capacitance of 183.3 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and a high energy density of 80 Wh kg(-1) when using an ionic liquid (EMIMBF4) as the electrolyte.

Based on phenotypic characteristics, 16S rDNA sequencing and FAME profiling, isolate BS02, identified as Bacillus clausii BS02 produced a biosurfactant (2.6 g l(-1)) when grown in basal salts mineral medium with sunflower oil soapstock (3% w\/v) at 30 degrees C and 120 rpm after 42 h. The cell free broth showed 82% emulsification activity, critical micelle concentration of 45 mg l(-1) and reduced the surface tension from 69.07 mN m(-1) to 30 mN m(-1). Acid precipitated and methanol extracted crude biosurfactant had 64.3%, 28%, and 4.5% (w\/w) of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate, respectively. The crude biosurfactant exhibited stability with oils, fats and non-aqueous phase liquids. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) revealed the functional groups and bonds; X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TG) showed the surface nature and thermostability of the biosurfactant, respectively. LC-ESI-MS identified the crude biosurfactant as a surfactin lipopeptide. A dose-dependent mortality against C. chinensis and M. hirsutus was observed using the crude biosurfactant, with a LC50 of 50 mu g ml(-1), indicating the first evidence of its insecticidal activity against pulse beetles and mealybugs.","642":"There is growing interest in developing printable paper sensors to enable rapid testing of analytes for environmental, food safety, and clinical applications. A major challenge is to find suitable bioinks that are amenable to high-speed printing and remain functional after printing. We report on a simple and effective approach wherein an aqueous ink composed of megadalton-sized tandem repeating structure-switching DNA aptamers (concatemeric aptamers) is used to rapidly create patterned paper sensors on filter paper by inkjet printing. These concatemeric aptamer reporters remain immobilized at the point of printing through strong adsorption but retain sufficient segmental mobility to undergo structure switching and fluorescence signaling to provide both qualitative and quantitative detection of small molecules and protein targets. The convenience of inkjet printing allows for the patterning of internally referenced sensors with multiplexed detection, and provides a generic platform for on-demand printing of sensors even in remote locations.","1783":"Most carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are grown at temperatures higher than 700 degrees C with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process and their growths are explained using the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Herein we report the realization of low temperature growth of CNFs and the interpretation of their growth with a vapor-facet-solid (VFS) mechanism. CNFs were synthesized via a thermal CVD process at the temperature as low as 350 degrees C and characterized using elemental analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. They feature unique structures of partly ordered discontinuous and hydrogen rich polymer sheets with a diameters of 0.5-1.5 nm. Based on a trimerization reaction occurring on the Fe catalyst surface, their initial growth step is the formation of six-membered rings from the source gas (i.e. C2H2). Subsequently, these rings act as structural unit and construct various larger planar molecules. Due to catalytic difference of the crystalline faces for a given Fe catalyst particle, a concentration gradient of hydrocarbon molecule introduces simultaneously. This gradient drives the diffusion of hydrocarbon molecule from the Fe(110) to the Fe(100) face, leading to the formation of disordered hydrogen-rich polymer structures. Highly graphitic CNFs can be obtained simply by annealing those polymer structures at higher temperatures. This growth mode proposed is workable whenever transition metal catalyzed nanostructures are synthesized by a thermal CVD process at low temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Reductions of the sample volume and assay time as well as full automation are required for their potential use in point-of-care diagnostic applications. Here, we present a highly efficient lab-on-a-disc composed of a TiO2 nanofibrous mat for sensitive detection of serum proteins with a broad dynamic range, with only 10 mu L of whole blood within 30 min. The TiO2 nanofibers provide high specific surface area as well as active functional groups to capture large amounts of antibodies on the surface. In addition, the device offers efficient mixing and washing for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, thus enhancing the overall detection sensitivity. We employ the device for the detection of cardiac biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), spiked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as well as in serum or whole blood. The device exhibited a wide dynamic range of six orders of magnitude from 1 pg mL(-1) (similar to 8 fM) to 100 ng mL(-1) (similar to 0.8 pM) and a low detection limit of 0.8 pg mL(-1) (similar to 6 fM) for CRP spiked in CRP-free serum and a dynamic range of 10 pg mL(-1) (similar to 0.4 pM) to 100 ng mL(-1) (similar to 4 nM) with a detection limit of 37 pg mL(-1) (similar to 1.5 pM) for cTnI spiked in whole blood.","6014":"The natural availability of flake graphite and the exceptional properties of graphene and graphene-polymer composites create a demand for simple, cost-effective, and scalable methods for top-down graphite exfoliation. This work presents a novel method of few layer graphite nanocomposite preparation directly from untreated flake graphite using a room temperature ionic liquid and laminar shear processing regimen. The ionic liquid serves both as a solvent and initiator for epoxy polymerization and is incorporated chemically into the matrix. This nanocomposite shows low electrical percolation (0.005 v\/v) and low thickness (1-3 layers) graphite\/graphene flakes by TEM. Additionally, the effect of processing conditions by rheometry and comparison with solvent-free conditions reveal the interactions between processing and matrix properties and provide insight into the theory of the chemical and physical exfoliation of graphite crystals and the resulting polymer matrix dispersion. An interaction model that correlates the interlayer shear physics of graphite flakes and processing parameters is proposed and tested.","6592":"The performance of anaerobic microbial vanadium(v) reduction using five ordinary dissolved organic carbon sources was evaluated. In general, V(v) removal efficiency decreased with an increase in the molecular weight of the carbon substrate. In addition, organic acids supported a higher V(v) removal than alcohols, thus achieving the highest V(v) removal efficiency of 75.6% using acetate during a 12 h operation, compared with lactate, glucose, citrate and soluble starch. A higher initial V(v) concentration led to a lower V(v) removal efficiency, while the extra addition of organics had little effect on its improvement. With an increase in the pH and conductivity, the V(v) removal efficiency first increased and then decreased. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis indicated the accumulation of Actinobacteria, Chlorobaculum of Chlorobi and Proteiniphilum of Bacteroidetes, which might be responsible for the function of the proposed system. This study provides a step forward for the remediation of V(v) from polluted groundwater, by employing a promising biotechnology.","7202":"Therapeutic-ultrasound-triggered shape memory was demonstrated for the first time with a melamine-enhanced poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) physical hydrogel. The addition of a small amount of melamine (up to. 1.5 wt %) in PVA results in a strong hydrogel due to the. multiple H-bonding between the two constituents. A temporary shape of the hydrogel can be obtained by deformation of the hydrogel (similar to 65 wt % water) at room temperature, followed by fixation of the deformation by freezing\/thawing the hydrogel under strain, which induces crystallization of PVA. We show that the ultrasound delivered by a commercially available device designed for the patient's pain relief could trigger the shape recovery process as a result of ultrasound-induced local heating in the hydrogel that melts the crystallized PVA cross-linking. This hydrogel is thus interesting for potential applications because it combines many desirable properties, being mechanically strong, biocompatible, and self-healable and displaying the shape memory capability triggered by a physiological stimulus.","37":"The swelling behavior and swelling mechanism of hydrogels can be greatly affected by the charge strength of ions in them. To investigate such effects, we prepared two gels: a carboxylic acid gel (CAG) and a poly(2-acrylamide-methyl propane sulfonic acid) gel (SAG) based on starchy polyacrylamide (PAM) nanocomposite gels, both with montmorillonite, which underwent in situ intercalation, and used them as probes in swelling experiments. The equilibrium swelling rates (ESRs) of the hydrogels in both salt water and acidic water strongly depended on the charge strength of the ions in the chains. SAG had a higher ESR than CAG at the same mole ratio of polymer\/water, which is attributed to the greater electrostatic repulsion between the strong electrolyte ions of SAG. Both water salinity and hydrogen ion contact of the hydrogels weakened ESR with the enhancement of charge ionic strength. The downward trend of ESR with increasing concentration of salt or hydrogen ions became weaker in SAG compared to CAG, which is attributed to the shielding and deprotonation effects of the strong electrolyte ions. Regarding the swelling mechanism, the chain relaxation occurred in neutral and acidic solutions for SAG and in neutral and weak acidic solutions for CAG, but water diffusion dominated in strong acidic solutions for CAG, leading to different swelling behaviors.","2206":"Wind energy is one of the most important renewable energy sources and many countries are predicted to increase wind energy portion of their whole national energy supply to about twenty percent in the next decade. One potential obstacle in the use of wind turbines to harvest wind energy is the maintenance of the wind turbine blades. The blades are a crucial and costly part of a wind turbine and over their service life can suffer from factors such as material degradation and fatigue, which can limit their effectiveness and safety. Thus, the ability to detect damage in wind turbine blades is of great significance for planning maintenance and continued operation of the wind turbine. This paper presents a review of recent research and development in the field of damage detection for wind turbine blades. Specifically, this paper reviews frequently employed sensors including fiber optic and piezoelectric sensors, and four promising damage detection methods, namely, transmittance function, wave propagation, impedance and vibration based methods. As a note towards the future development trend for wind turbine sensing systems, the necessity for wireless sensing and energy harvesting is briefly presented. Finally, existing problems and promising research efforts for online damage detection of turbine blades are discussed.","6302":"Efficient utilization of fumed silica with thermoset resins had been investigated for high temperature applications, which led to extensive exploration of newer materials. The present prospect represents a similar progress in the field of thermoplastic material and focuses on the burgeoning field of heat sinking materials and hydrophobicity. Nanoscale coalescence of Nano Fumed Silica (NFS) filler in a polycarbonate (PC) matrix is ameliorated by two different techniques viz. solvent casting and spray coating. The spray-coating technique was reconnoitred by numerical modelling parameters. The characteristic peak appears at 1094 cm(-1) and 3821 cm(-1) in the FTIR which corroborate the interaction between PC and NFS. PC\/NFS solution with workable viscosity 25 cP exemplifies homogeneous dispersion in the PC matrix ascertained by FESEM with utmost loading of 10 wt% NFS. An 85% increment in contact angle was observed which justified with accretion in surface roughness (12.5 nm) of the composite as well as from the Cassie-Baxter model. Effective thermal conductivity of the composite was mathematically computed with 46% decrement as compared to a pristine PC counterpart, which is in agreement with the TGA results as char residue is enhanced from 22% to 49%. The results affirm that the spray-coated samples give more efficacy in terms of heat sinking capacity and hydrophobic characteristics as compared to solvent-casted films and justifies its competency to replace conventional thermoplastic composites. So, these membranes can be effectively and economically employed as heat sinking source in automotive\/automobile industry, electronic gadgets and defence electronics.","2685":"Understanding the atomistic mechanisms of carbon structure formation during templated multi-step carbonization is very important for further optimization of carbon fiber mechanical properties. Here with use of reactive force field molecular dynamics we have elucidated the mechanism driving double-walled carbon nanotube- and graphite nanoparticle-based in situ templating of polyacrylonitrile derived fibers. Depending on carbonization temperature, the mechanism involves either physisorption (physical templating) or chemisorption (chemical templating) of the fiber medium to the template surface. In either case, strong interaction between template and medium leads to the production of aligned structures that are more robust for nanotubes than graphite. We provide a unique analysis of atomistic simulations that enables quantitative comparison of templating results with the relevant electron diffraction data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With Coulomb efficiencies (CE) of up to 50%, the electrochemical decarboxylation of fatty acids in methanolic and ethanolic solutions leads to the formation of diesel-like olefin\/ether mixtures. Triglycerides can be directly converted in aqueous solutions by using sonoelectrochemistry, with olefins as the main products (with a CE of more than 20%). The latter reaction, however, is terminated at around 50% substrate conversion by the produced side-product glycerol. An energy analysis shows that the electrochemical olefin synthesis can be an energetically competitive, sustainable, andin comparison with established processeseconomically feasible alternative for the exploitation of fats and oils for biofuel production.","2620":"Silver nanowire (AgNW) has drawn tremendous attention and is regarded as one of the candidate materials for future flexible displays and sensors. Compatible coating, patterning, and transferring processes are essential for device fabrications. We proposed facile solution processes for AgNWs patterning based on wettability, aligning with microchannel, and transferring onto arbitrary substrates to study how it can be used for actual applications. Also, piezoelectric- type and projected capacitive-type of touch sensors were demonstrated, respectively.","7370":"A new route for the selective synthesis of renewable 1,3-cyclopentanediol was developed by the aqueous phase rearrangement of furfuryl alcohol to 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone followed by hydrogenation. The presence of a small amount of base catalysts is beneficial for the aqueous phase rearrangement of furfuryl alcohol to 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone. Such a promotion effect of base catalysts can be rationalized by restraining the generation of levulinic acid which may catalyze the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol. In the hydrogenation of 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone to 1,3-cyclopentanediol, an evident solvent effect was noticed. Higher carbon yields of 1,3-cyclopentanediol were obtained when tetrahydrofuran was used as the solvent. In the large scale tests with high initial concentrations of feedstocks, a high overall carbon yield (72.0%) of 1,3-cyclopentanediol was achieved over cheap catalysts (MgAl-HT and RANEY (R) Ni). As a potential application, 1,3-cyclopentanediol as obtained was successfully used as a monomer in the synthesis of polyurethane.","95":"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has shown high promise in analysis and bioanalysis, wherein noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) such as silver nanoparticles were employed as substrates because of their strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties. However, SERS-based pH sensing was restricted because of the aggregation of NMNPs in acidic medium or biosamples with high ionic strength. Herein, by using the electrostatic interaction as a driving force, AgNPs are assembled on the surface of ethylene imine polymer (PEI)\/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) electrospun nanofibers, which are then applied as highly sensitive and reproducible SERS substrate with an enhancement factor (EF) of 10(7)-10(8). When p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP) is used as an indicator with its b(2) mode, a good and wide linear response to pH ranging from 2.56 to 11.20 could be available, and the as-prepared nanocomposite fibers then could be fabricated as excellent pH sensors in complicated biological samples such as urine, considering that the pH of urine could reflect the acid base status of a person. This work not only emerges a cost-effective, direct, and convenient approach to homogeneously decorate AgNPs on the surface of polymer nanofibers but also supplies a route for preparing other noble metal nanofibrous sensing membranes.","1084":"A trace-level chemiluminescent (CL) sensor for the determination of phenacetin, utilising CdTe quantum dots@luminol (QDs@luminol) for signal amplification, based on a chitosan\/magnetic graphene oxide-molecularly imprinted polymer (CsMG-MIP) as a biological recognition material was fabricated. CdTe QDs@luminol, which was used in the preparation process for the sensor, could amplify the signal of the CL sensor through chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) while reducing the consumption of luminol. The CsMG-MIP, taking full advantage of the abundant hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan which provide a Lot of sites for the formation of hydrogen bonds in SMIP, using graphene oxide to improve the adsorption capacity and Fe3O4 nanoparticles to make the preparation of the recognition unit simple and easy, was introduced into the CL sensor. Under the optimized conditions of the CL sensor, phenacetin could be assayed in the range of 3.0 x 10(-9)-3.0 x 10(-7) mol L-1 with a detection Limit of 8.2 x 10(-10) mol L-1 (3 delta). With the advantages of amplifying the CL signal through CRET and reducing the consumption of luminol simultaneously, the sensor was successfully applied to the determination of trace-level phenacetin in real samples with a high selectivity and with the reagent economized.","169":"The interaction of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) Langmuir monolayers as a model biomembrane with small silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) similar in size but coated with different capping molecules such as citrate (CIT-AgNPs) and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA-AgNPs), both negatively charged at physiological pH, is studied using a multi-technique approach. Both CIT-AgNPs and MBA-AgNPs expose carboxyl groups and have similar zeta potentials, but differ in the aliphatic or aromatic nature of the capping agent. Results show that AgNPs exhibit quite different behaviors: CIT-AgNPs weakly adsorb on DMPC, while MBA-AgNPs irreversibly adsorb on the interface and remain there upon monolayer compression. It is also shown that there is a cooperative effect of many ligands in the interactions between MBA-AgNPs and DMPC, as MBA molecules in solution are unable to strongly adsorb on the phospholipid monolayer surface. We propose an explanation based on the surface charge density and on the chemical nature of the capping molecule based on XPS studies and on DFT calculations.","1617":"Biopolymers are often subjected to surface modification in order to improve their surface characteristics. The goal of this study is to show the use of plasma technology to enhance the adhesion of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) shoulder prostheses. Two different plasma techniques (low pressure plasma activation and atmospheric pressure plasma polymerization) are performed on UHMWPE to increase the adhesion between (1) the polymer and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement and (2) the polymer and osteoblast cells. Both techniques are performed using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). A previous paper showed that low pressure plasma activation of UHMWPE results in the incorporation of oxygen-containing functional groups, which leads to an increased surface wettability. Atmospheric pressure plasma polymerization of methylmethacrylate (MMA) on UHMWPE results in a PMMA-like coating, which could be deposited with a high degree of control of chemical composition and layer thickness. The thin film also proved to be relatively stable upon incubation in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS). This paper discusses the next stage of the study, which includes testing the adhesion of the plasma-activated and plasma-polymerized samples to bone cement through pull-out tests and testing the cell adhesion and proliferation on the samples. In order to perform the pull-out tests, all samples were cut to standard dimensions and fixed in bone cement in a reproducible way with a sample holder specially designed for this purpose. The cell adhesion and proliferation were tested by means of an MTS assay and live\/dead staining after culturing MC3T3 osteoblast cells on UHMWPE samples. The results show that both plasma activation and plasma polymerization significantly improve the adhesion to bone cement and enhance cell adhesion and proliferation. In conclusion, it can be stated that the use of plasma technology can lead to an implant with improved quality and a subsequent longer lifespan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we report the crystallization behavior of P3HS in aged solution and the effects of aging time, solution concentration, and solvents on the self-assembly of P3HS are explored. A novel bundlelike spherulitic morphology is observed, which is so far scarcely observed in polyselenophenes. These P3HS spherulites consist of nanoribbons in which the polymer chains adopt a flat-on orientation associated with form II crystals. The formation mechanism and kinetics of P3HS spherulites are discussed in detail. Overall, this work offers an effective way to demonstrate how the P3HS crystallize in solution and the correlation between its morphology and crystalline structure, which improves our understanding of P3HS crystallization and facilitates the ongoing exploration of using such spherulites in organic electronics.","2899":"A dicopper(II) complex can be covalently linked to palmitate\/palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PA\/POPC) liposomes using the following one-pot strategy: preformed [Cu-2(bpbp)(PA)](ClO4)(2) (bpbp(-)=2,6-bis((N,N-bis(2-picolyl)amino)methyl)-4-tertbutylphenolato) was incorporated into POPC liposomes with a loading of up to 10mol%. Despite its shape and charge, the decoration of PA\/POPC liposomes with {Cu-2(bpbp)}(3+) did not disrupt the liposome structure; however, the mean liposome diameter increased from about 130nm (0mol% dicopper complex) to about 150nm (10mol% dicopper complex). Single-crystal X-ray structures furnish snapshots' of the pH-dependent solution state derivatives of {Cu-2(bpbp)}(3+), and model the structure of the [Cu-2(bpbp)(PA)](2+) head group at the surface of the liposomes. An impressive plasticity in the intramolecular non-bonded Cu....Cu distance for these ions, ranging from 3 to 4 angstrom, in [Cu-2(bpbp)OH](2+), [Cu-2(bpbp)(OAc)(H2O)](2+) and [Cu-2(bpbp)(H2O)(2)](3+) allows for their utility as labile reagents in water. Remarkably, the flexible dicopper site is selective for a single carboxylate ligand, so that [Cu-2(bpbp)(PA)](2+) is favoured even in the presence of other chemically similar oxoanions, such as CO32-, HCO3-, NO3-, ClO4-, ReO4- and CF3SO3-.","3529":"Templating nanocrystals into mesoporous electrodes using an organic porogen typically requires thermal oxidation at >400 degrees C to completely remove the organic material and afford good electronic properties. These oxidation conditions are incompatible with many NC materials. Here, we demonstrate that nitrocellulose can afford mesoporous CdS and CZTS nanocrystal thin film electrodes at only 250-300 degrees C in air or under argon. Remarkable control over the surface area and the average pore size (20-100 nm) in thin films are demonstrated by varying the ratio of preformed nanocrystals and nitrocellulose. Moreover the mesoporous electrodes exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties. Photoelectrochemical performance is enhanced due to the increased active surface area, showing an 8-fold photocurrent increase over compact nanocrystal films, and an IPCE over 70%.","7090":"In this study, a novel micro-system made of a fluid circuit board and various functional components, inspired by integrated microcircuit techniques, was developed. The circuit board was fabricated on a thermoplastic sheet using two-dimensional (2D) cutting technology. The functional components, including mixers, dilutors, reactors, pumps, retreaters, and detectors, were fabricated via paper (or membrane) cutting\/folding and integrated into the system, similar to the way that electronic components are integrated into a micro-integrated circuit board. This system, validated through the rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the starch catabolism process, could potentially be another microfluidic system for analytical science.","4668":"Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cooling using a phase change material (PCM)\/compressed expanded natural graphite (CENG) composite is investigated, for a cylindrical battery cell and for a battery module scale. An electrochemistry model (average model) is coupled to the thermal model, with the addition of a one-dimensional model for the solution and solid diffusion using the nodal network method. The analysis of the temperature distribution of the battery module scale has shown that a two-dimensional model is sufficient to describe the transient temperature rise. In consequence, a two-dimensional cell-centred finite volume code for unstructured meshes is developed with additions of the electrochemistry and phase change. This two-dimensional thermal model is used to investigate a new and usual battery module configurations cooled by PCM\/CENG at different discharge rates. The comparison of both configurations with a constant source term and heat generation based on the electrochemistry model showed the superiority of the new design. In this study, comparisons between the predictions from different analytical and computational tools as well as open-source packages were carried out, and close agreements have been observed.

The as-prepared hybrid Au\/PNIPAM gels were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), etc. The fluorescence intensity of the Au\/PNIPAM gels exhibited excellent thermosensitive properties. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching and enhancement process was fully reversible after repeated heating and cooling cycles.

Materials dosed with steel slag fines at different levels of substitution (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were designed, employing commercial admixtures in the samples. A comparative study of the most significant mortar properties is conducted, such as workability, adhesiveness, water retentivity and mechanical strength, between the mortars prepared with natural fine aggregate and those manufactured with additions of slag. The results indicate that technically viable mortars may be obtained for their use in construction and building, which thereby achieve the reuse and valorization of waste products that would otherwise be disposed of in landfill sites.

To improve thermal and acoustic properties on lime-cement mortars, fulfilling other physical, mechanical and technical requirements, a gap-graded aggregate (GGA), three lightweight aggregates (LWA) (expanded clay, perlite and vermiculite) and fibers (cellulose and polypropylene) were used. The water to binder ratios were fixed in order to get a plastic consistency for all the fresh compositions. The experimental program assessed the influence of those components on free shrinkage and cracking at early age (24 h) and physical and mechanical properties, thermal conductivity and sound absorption coefficient on hardened mortar samples. A parametric analysis allowed to identify some relations linking water to binder ratio to open porosity, free shrinkage and cracking risk at early ages; apparent density to thermal conductivity of samples without fibers and open porosity to mechanical performance and sound absorption coefficient. Lightweight aggregates and fibers showed a different behavior, especially on thermal and acoustic performance, because of a different pore structure. The combined effect of GGA, LWA and fibers improved thermal and acoustic performance of lime-cement mortars. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Two bolaamphiphilic self-assemblies were applied as a biomimetic catalyst of p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) hydrolysis and an optical sensor probe that detects p-NPA hydrolysis through photoluminescence quenching by p-nitrophenol (p-NP), the product of p-NPA hydrolysis. One bolaamphiphilic self-assembly with a histidine moiety catalytically hydrolyzed the p-NPA substrate, and the other self-assembly of tyrosyl bolaamphiphile monitored the product of p-NP by photoluminescence quenching. The progression of the reaction and quenching degree were adjusted by controlling the quantity of histidyl and tyrosyl self-assemblies, respectively. The reaction and subsequent sensing cascade could be interrupted by a reducing agent. The addition of NaBH4 induced the chemical conversion of p-NP to p-aminophenol, which retarded photoluminescence quenching. Thus, it was demonstrated that hydrolysis of an organic substrate and subsequent monitoring of the hydrolysis reaction could be achieved through a combination of independent bolaamphiphilic self-assemblies. This study demonstrated the construction of a catalytic reaction and detection system incorporating designer biomimetic self-assemblies whose functionalities were devised to realize deliberate functions.","5041":"A novel 1D polymeric copper(II) complex with L-arginine and a linear bridged 4,4 '-bipyridine with a formula of {[Cu(L-Arg)(2)(mu-4,4 '-bpy)]Cl-2 center dot 3H(2)O}(infinity) (1) (where L-Arg = L-arginine, 4,4 '-bpy = 4,4 '-bipyridine) was synthesized. The crystal structure and properties of the product were characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, Raman, NIR-vis-UV electronic and EPR), magnetic methods, and microbiological examinations. The crystals of 1 crystallized in a trigonal system and a space group of P3(2)21 was characterized with a = b = 12.31 angstrom, c = 18.45 angstrom, V = 2420 angstrom(3), Z = 3, alpha = beta = 90 degrees and gamma = 120 degrees. The N and O donor atoms of trans-chelated L-Arg zwitterions and two N atoms of the 4,4 '-bpy molecule form a tetragonal distorted octahedral geometry around the copper(II) ions with static character (T = 0.748). The diffuse-reflectance electronic spectrum of 1 is characteristic of the [CuN2N2 ' O-2] chromophore. The EPR spectrum of frozen 1 (at 77 K) dissolved in water is related to the N2O2 set (g(perpendicular to) = 2.057, g(parallel to) = 2.258 and A(parallel to) = 169 G). The structure of the [Cu(L-Arg)(2)(mu-4,4 '-bpy)](2+) model complex was optimized at the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 levels. The calculations of the atomic spin densities on the atoms in the doublet state of the model complex revealed that, with regard to the ligands, the spin population is distributed mainly over the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of L-arginine. The antimicrobial activities were examined against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains: Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus hirae, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri; and fungi: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans. Complex 1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, both in their growth inhibition as well as in microbial killing.","6114":"Economic growth is associated with a rapid rise in the use of natural resources, and has potential environmental impacts at local and\/or global scales. Possible options to control environmental impacts associated with consumption of natural resources include the introduction of easier way to identify the consumption of natural resources and the associated environmental impacts through the global supply chain, and the establishment of sound material cycle to reduce the consumption of national resources. Nickel and nickel-containing materials, whose global demand has risen rapidly in recent years, play a crucial role in modern society, with uses in numerous types of infrastructure and technology. At the same time, the life cycles of nickel-containing materials are always associated with environmental risks and challenges (Nakajima et al. 2014). Especially, the environmental impacts caused by nickel mining has received particular attention in recent years, because the world's leading countries and regions of nickel ore production (e.g., New Caledonia, Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia) are also typically known as biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000). However, we can see material and\/or quality losses of nickel throughout anthropogenic nickel cycle (Reck and Graedel 2012). Possible options to reduce the environmental impacts associated with nickel mining include nickel recovery from wastes such as spent batteries and catalysts, plating sewage, and industrial water. Recovery of these wastes has a potential to reduce natural resource consumption, and to reduce a negative impact on the environment and human health if they contaminate soil, water, and air. In this study, we discussed a bottleneck for establishing sound material cycle of nickel. Hence, upon assessing the generation and processing of nickel-containing wastes, we clarify the quality of nickel-containing waste, as well as the technical bottlenecks for closing the loop on the material cycle of nickel. Sound material cycle of nickel-containing steel scrap has been established in Japan; with reports of almost of nickel-based stainless scrap being recycled (Daigo et al. 2010). Therefore, this study addressed nickel-containing waste that are of particular concern for losses, such as pre-consumer materials with low-grade nickel content. This study identified characteristics of nickel containing pre-consumer materials generated from steel production industry (stainless steel), electrodepositing tool production industry, edible oils and fats industry, and nickel plating industry.","1410":"Monolithic nanoporous iron was prepared via carbothermal reduction of interpenetrating networks of polybenzoxazine and iron oxide nanoparticles. Excess carbon was burned off at 600 degrees C in air, and oxides produced from partial oxidation of the Fe(0) network were reduced back to Fe(0) with H-2 at different temperatures (temp) ranging from 300 to 1300 degrees C. Samples were carbon-free, for temp <= 400 degrees C also oxide-free, and are referred to according to the final H-2-reduction temperature as Fe-temp. Fe-temp monoliths were infiltrated with perchlorates, dried exhaustively and were ignited with a flame in open air. Most experimentation was conducted with LiClO4. Depending on temp, monoliths fizzled out (<400 degrees C), exploded violently (500-900 degrees C) or behaved as thermites (>= 950 degrees C). Samples sealed in evacuated tubes did not explode, while if sealed under N-2 the explosive effect was intensified. Thus, explosive behavior was attributed to rapid heating and expansion of gas filling nanoporous space. However, although that condition was necessary for explosive behavior, it was not sufficient. Based on SEM, particle sizes via N-2, sorption, electrical conductivity measurements and mechanical strength data under quasi-static compression, it was concluded that the boundaries between the three types of behavior after ignition were associated with (a) mild sintering (fizzling\/explosive boundary at around 500 degrees C); and, (b) melting-like fusion of skeletal nanoparticles (explosive\/thermite boundary at around 950 degrees C). Overall, mechanically weaker networks fizzled out; too strong behaved as thermites; networks of intermediate strength exploded. For thermite behavior in particular, other factors may be also at play, such as a combination of reduced porosity, a substoichiometric ambunt of LiClO4 and a slower heat release rate. The latter was supported by TGA data in O-2 and was attributed to a slower rate of oxidation of progressively thicker nanostructures as the H-2-reduction temperature increased.","6523":"The chiral liquid crystal self-assembly behavior of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) opens a fantastic way to design functional nanocomposites with advanced optical properties. Herein, we demonstrate that crack free, large size thermal reduced graphene (TRG)\/CNC composite films with highly ordered, layered structures at the submicrometer level can be obtained through a vacuum-assisted self-assembly (VASA) technique. The results show that the addition of a small amount of TRG (<= 0.5 wt%) is compatible with the self-assembly of CNC under flow field. Benefiting from the homogeneous dispersion of TRG in the chiral nematic phase of CNC, the resultant TRG\/CNC films present uniformly metallic iridescence, which can be reversibly changed by the hydration or dehydration process similar to the water response of beetles Tmesisternus isabellae's elytra. Moreover, the TRG\/CNC composite film with only 0.3 wt% TRG loading exhibits high electrical conductivities. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to combine the intriguing self-assembly ability of CNC with the extraordinary optical and electrical properties of graphene for constructing multifunctional biomimetic materials and sensors.","1153":"Dielectric analysis of tannin-based carbon foams with different pore sizes, produced at different densities, was carried out in wide microwave frequency range (8GHz - 35GHz). Both dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of carbon foams at 8GHz, were high, i.e. more than 70 and close to 10 S\/m respectively, and increased with carbon foams density according to power laws. High microwave complex dielectric permittivity values of carbon foams reported here, along with other valuable properties such as \"green\" origin, low price, lightness, chemical inertness, thermal stability and high conductivity in static regime, open new routes for producing effective electromagnetic shields and filters from tannin-based carbonaceous porous structures.","5250":"Cellulose derivatives containing associating hydrophobic groups along their hydrophilic backbone are used as rheology modifiers in the formulation of water-based spray paints, medicinal sprays, cosmetics and printable inks. Jetting and spraying applications of these materials involve progressive thinning and break-up of a fluid column or sheet into drops. Strong extensional kinematics develop in the thinning fluid neck. In viscous Newtonian fluids, inertial and viscous stresses oppose the surface tension-driven instability. In aqueous solutions of polymers such as Ethyl Hydroxy-Ethyl Cellulose (EHEC), chain elongation provides additional elastic stresses that can delay the capillary-driven pinch-off, influencing the sprayability or jettability of the complex fluid. In this study, we quantify the transient response of thinning filaments of cellulose ether solutions to extensional flows in a Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) and in a forced jet undergoing break-up using Rayleigh Ohnesorge Jetting Extensional Rheometry (ROJER). We also characterize the steady state molecular deformations using measurements of the flow-induced birefringence and excess pressure drop in an extensional stagnation point flow using a Cross-Slot Extensional Rheometer (CSER). We show that under the high extension rates encountered in jetting and spraying, the semi-dilute solutions of hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxy-ethyl cellulose (hmEHEC) exhibit extensional thinning, while the unmodified bare chains of EHEC display an increase in extensional viscosity, up to a plateau value. For both EHEC and hmEHEC dispersions, the low extensibility of the cellulose derivatives limits the Trouton ratio observed at the highest extension rates attained (close to 105 s(-1)) to around 10-20. The reduction in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate for the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether is primarily caused by the disruption of a transient elastic network that is initially formed by intermolecular association of hydrophobic stickers. This extensional thinning behavior, in conjunction with the low extensibility of the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether additives, makes these rheology modifiers ideal for controlling the extensional rheology in formulations that require jetting or spraying, with minimal residual stringiness or stranding.","1414":"Transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding for the first ten strands of the GFP protein (GFP1-10) provides the means to detect cytosolic peptide import at low micromolar concentrations. Cytosolic import of the eleventh strand of the GFP protein either by electroporation or by cell-penetrating peptide-mediated import leads to formation of the full-length GFP protein and fluorescence. An increase in sensitivity is achieved through structural modifications of the peptide and the expression of GFP1-10 as a fusion protein with mCherry.","6299":"Versatile maneuverable electrospinning process was exploited to fabricate intertwined heterostructure polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers with average diameter of 141.4 nm by incorporating essential oil Syzygium aromaticum for antibacterial drug delivery systems. We have demonstrated the formation of seamless heterostructure of PAN\/Syzygium aromaticum nanocomposites by incorporating 0.1% electrolyte solution, which not only achieved inhibition zone of 1.8-2.8 cm against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria but also exhibited 100% cell viability of NIH\/3T3 cell lines. Electrospun fibers were observed to be flexible and composed of continuous, cylindrical and randomly oriented fibers. FT-IR peak at 3398 cm(-1) reveals the ultra wettabililty nature of nanocomposite which was confirmed by the contact angle measurement. Further, the Korsmeyer-Peppas model was explored to study the mechanism and kinetics of the antibacterial drug release system. Overall result suggests that electrospinning can be employed as a novel, facile route for the large scale fabrication of nanoscale PAN heterostructure hydrophilic composite for broad range of biomedical applications.","1730":"A core-sheath structured carbon nanofiber@nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CNF@NPC) composite is synthesized as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Particularly, the eco-friendly bacterial cellulose ( BC) is used as both template and precursor for the synthesis of CNF@NPC through the carbonization of bacterial cellulose@polypyrrole (BC@PPy). Due to the particular core-sheath structure and the synergetic effect between the CNF core layer and the NPC outer layer, the CNF@NPC exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high reversible specific capacity (240 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) over 100 cycles), excellent rate performance (146.5 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)), and superior cycling stability (148.8 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) over 400 cycles).

Compared with common sulfur cathodes, the cathode with chitosan shows an enhanced initial discharge capacity from 950 to 1145 mA h g(-1) at C\/10. The reversible specific capacity after 100 cycles increases from 508 mA h g(-1) to 680 mA h g(-1) and 473 to 646 mA h g(-1) at rates of C\/2 and 1 C, respectively. In addition, batteries with separators that are coated with a carbon\/chitosan layer can exhibit a high discharge capacity of 830 mA h g(-1) at C\/2 after 100 cycles and 675 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 200 cycles with the capacity fading to as low as 0.11% per cycle.

The capped form is when the magnetic nanoparticles adhere to the nanotube tips, whereas the uncapped configuration forms when the magnetic nanoparticle shifts to the nanotube sidewall. The feasibility and likelihood of these two structural forms of the nanocontainer depend on the energetic profile associated with the transitions between them. This paper discusses two approaches for controlling that balance: the covalent functionalization of the nanotube sidewalls by incorporation of polar amide groups and noncovalent functionalization based on adsorption of charged fine colloid nanoparticles. Single- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes were analyzed as was the presence of cisplatin molecules encapsulated in the nanotube inner cavities. Both approaches might result in obtaining the preferred energetic balance, that is, a less stable uncapped state and relatively low activation barrier for spontaneous transition from the uncapped to the capped state. However, adsorption of fine colloids turned out to be too weak to provide long-term stability of the system. Amide functionalization provides the best results in terms of the energetic profile, stability, and other system parameters.","3353":"Nanomaterials are promising in the field of optical sensors due to their unique properties. Emeraldine base of polyaniline (Nano EB-PANI) was prepared, characterized and applied as an optical formaldehyde sensor. FTIR data confirm the formation of the EB-PANI. TEM and SEM revealed the size and shape of the nanoscale EB-PANI. XRD showed that the obtained nano EB-PANI has a partial crystalline nature. The sensing mechanism is based on the reaction of formaldehyde with Nano EB-PANI- to form a complex as described by molecular modeling HF\/3-21G** level of theory. Results showed that Nano EB-PANI- detect low concentrations of formaldehyde ranging from 0.0003 to 0.9 ppm in a dose-dependent manner. The molecular modeling theory analysis showed that formaldehyde could interact with the amine of EB-PANI in, ring 3 or 4 or both together. The binding energy and dipole moment of the interaction between formaldehyde and polyaniline nanosensor were calculated by HF\/3-21g** level of theory. The interaction with ring 3-NH gives a less stable product with a high dipole moment 6.978 Debye comparing with 1.678 Debye for the product of formaldehyde interaction with the terminal ring 4-NH. The development of such novel EB-PANI nanosensor can be used as, reliable and sensitive formaldehyde sensor.","3000":"A new polymeric laponite nanoclay heterogeneous catalytic system based on HPMC (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose) was developed for direct Mannich-type reaction of ketones with substituted benzaldehydes and anilines to afford corresponding beta-amino ketones in good to high yields. Interestingly, cyclic ketones exhibited different chemoselectivity. Cyclopentanone underwent aldol condensation to give crossed-aldol product, while cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone afforded corresponding Mannich adducts. In the case of cyclohexanone, stereoselectivity was changed depending on the nature of the substitution on benzaldehydes, in which, moderate electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups afforded the anti isomer as major products, but strongly electron-donating substituted benzaldehydes led to syn isomer as the major Mannich adducts. Mannich reaction with cycloheptanone led to Mannich adducts with excellent syn selectivity.","4190":"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) anchored to carbon nanofiber (CNF) hybrids were synthesized using a facile coprecipitation method. This report demonstrates an effective strategy to intrinsically improve the conductivity and supercapacitive performance of the hybrids by inducing oxygen vacancies. Oxygen deficiency-related defect analyses were performed qualitatively as well as quantitatively using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All of the analyses clearly indicate an increase in oxygen deficiencies in the hybrids with an increase in the vacuum-annealing temperature. The nonstoichiometric oxygen vacancy is mainly induced via the migration of the lattice oxygen into interstitial sites at elevated temperature (300 degrees C), followed by diffusion into the gaseous phase with further increase in the annealing temperature (600 degrees C) in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. This induction of oxygen vacancy is corroborated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which depicts the oxygen-vacancy-induced bandgap narrowing of the ZnO NPs within the hybrids. At a current density of 3 A g(-1), the hybrid electrode exhibited higher energy density (119.85 Wh kg(-1)) and power density (19.225 kW kg(-1)) compared to a control ZnO electrode (48.01 Wh kg(-1) and 17.687 kW kg(-1)). The enhanced supercapacitive performance is mainly ascribed to the good interfacial contact between CNF and ZnO, high oxygen deficiency, and fewer defects in the hybrid. Our results are expected to provide new insights into improving the electrochemical properties of various composites\/hybrids.","5165":"A class of novel nickel cobalt oxide hollow nanosponges were synthesized through a sodium borohydride reduction strategy.

Herein we reported the first example of a hydrogel responsive to hydrogen sulphide (H2S). H2S is an important gasotransmitter whose deregulation has been associated with a number of pathological conditions. Our hydrogel design is based on the functionalization of an ultrashort hydrogelating peptide sequence with an azidobenzyl moiety, which was reported to react with H2S selectively under physiological conditions. The resulting peptide was able to produce hydrogels at a concentration as low as 0.1 wt%. It could then be fully degraded in the presence of excess H2S. We envision that the novel hydrogel developed in this study may provide useful tools for biomedical research.","1699":"In this work, we examined the reasons underlying the humidity-induced morphological changes of electrospun fibers and suggest a method of controlling the electrospun fiber morphology under high humidity conditions. We fabricated OPV devices composed of electrospun fibers, and the performance of the OPV devices depends significantly on the fiber morphology. The evaporation rate of a solvent at various relative humidity was measured to investigate the effects of the relative humidity during electrospinning process. The beaded nanofiber morphology of electrospun fibers was originated due to slow solvent evaporation rate under high humidity conditions. To increase the evaporation rate under high humidity conditions, warm air was applied to the electrospinning system. The beads that would have formed on the electrospun fibers were completely avoided, and the power conversion efficiencies of OPV devices fabricated under high humidity conditions could be restored. These results highlight the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method for improving the reproducibility of electrospun nanofibers and performances of devices consisting of the electrospun nanofibers, regardless of the relative humidity.","2312":"Biomass is an abundant renewable energy source and a potential feedstock for producing industrial chemicals. Consequently, biomass has received growing attention as a feedstock for production of advanced materials, because of the added value of the end products and the environmental acceptance of the processes.

Adding value to tropical vegetable resources and proposing a replacement for asbestos are challenges for chemists. Sugar cane bagasse is evaluated both as a mineral replacement and as a reinforcement in cementitious paste. In this matrix, ordinary Portland cement is partly replaced by natural pozzolan and bagasse ashes; a ternary binder is obtained. The pastes reinforced with vegetable fibers are prepared by the incorporation of untreated and pyrolyzed bagasse fibers (2-6 wt%) in this modified matrix. The thermal conductivity and the bending strength of the composite pastes, placed in various environments (curing chamber and water), are evaluated and compared to those of composite pastes made with commercial cement and bagasse fibers, exposed to identical aging conditions. The more relevant results are obtained in the curing chamber: the composite pastes prepared with the ternary matrix conduct less heat than the commercial binder composites at 28 d, and better bending strengths are obtained with the ternary binder composites at 28 and 90 d, particularly with the untreated bagasse fibers.","6036":"The synthesis and characterization of novel sulfonated polyimide (SPI)\/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blend membranes for use in vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) are presented in this work. The SPIs with angled structure were synthesized using 4,4-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), sodium 2-aminosulphanilate (SAS) and 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dimethyldiphenylmethane (DMMDA). The degree of sulfonation (DS) was regulated through variation of the molar ratio of SAS to DMMDA. The PVA\/SPI blend membranes were prepared and applied in VRBs. Many basic properties of the membranes were characterized, particularly the water and oxidative stability. The blend membranes exhibit excellent water and oxidative stability. The proton conductivity, vanadium ion permeability and proton selectivity increase with DS due to the highly-dispersed phase-separated microstructure. In VRB single cell tests, the VRBs with blend membranes show lower charge capacity loss, higher coulombic efficiency (CE) and higher energy efficiency (EE) than with Nafion 117 membrane. Furthermore, the blend membranes present stable performances up to 100 cycles without significant decline in EE. All experimental results indicate that the blend membranes show promising prospects for application in VRBs.","4756":"Natural cotton was dissolved in a room-temperature ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl acetate and wet-jet electrospun to obtain nanoscale cotton fibers with a substantially reduced diameter- and therefore an increased surface area-relative to natural cotton fibers. The resulting nano-cotton fibers were esterified with trityl-3-mercaptopropionic acid, which after selective de-tritylation afforded nano-cotton fibers containing reactive thiol functionality. Silver nanoparticles that were covalently attached to these sulfhydryl groups were assembled next. The microstructure of the resulting nanocomposite was characterized, and the antibacterial activity of the resulting nano-cotton Ag-nanoparticle composite was also studied. This nanocomposite showed significant activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.","6561":"The existence of numerous non-conductive regions retards the further functionalization of heterogeneous membrane surface. In this report, a modification scheme for covalent immobilization of polyethyleneimine (PEI) multilayer on heterogeneous cation exchange membrane (CEM) was developed by means of diazonium-induced carboxyl group grafting. Of particular note are the influences of some important modification conditions, including the molecular weight of PEI and its deposition times, which were explored and understood. Series of electrodialysis experiments confirmed the achievement of the monovalent cation permselectivity. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the PEI coating can also effectively improve surface homogeneity and then alleviate concentration polarization behaviour during the electrodialysis process.","7157":"To investigate the effect of unusual substitutions in the phenothiazine core toward the development of deep blue emitters, two compounds have been designed and synthesized by integrating electron donor and electron acceptor units in a nonconventional fashion. Compared with the conventional strategy, we brought two acceptor units in para-relationship to each other on the phenothiazine backbone. Noticeably, emission was shifted hypsochromically to 430 nm in compound 3 from 480 nm, as observed for compound 2. Theoretical studies also provided a deep insight into the excitation and emission properties of the studied compounds. Frontier molecular orbitals and natural transition orbitals revealed that the extent of conjugation in compound 3 was much limited compared to 2. Single crystal X-ray studies helped to predict the packing modes of these compounds in relation to the substitution pattern. The butterfly angle in phenothiazine was found to be the lowest in compound 3. The phenothiazine ring was found to attain a plane perpendicular to the plane of the rest of molecule in 3 which was responsible to delimit the intermolecular stacking at the molecular level. The solution processed devices gave external quantum efficiencies of 2.7% and 1.6% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of 0.16, 0.13 and 0.16, 0.09 for devices using 2 and 3 as the dopant in the host matrix respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of acceptors in para-relationship on the phenothiazine core is a promising design strategy towards deep blue emitters.","4331":"Despite the high number of research articles regarding the development of new high performance electrolytes for Li-ion batteries, relatively little work has been carried out for the investigation of green, mechanically robust, safe and commercially applicable paper separators. In this work, newly elaborated paper separators made of natural cellulose fibres are prepared by filtration dewatering. Paper separators show high porosity, wettability and mechanical robustness along with remarkable ion transport characteristics. The novel approach is conceptually validated by constant current charge\/discharge cycling in a lab-scale Li-ion all-paper \"pouch\" cell assembled with a four-layer handsheet stacking separator in combination with a graphite-based paper-anode and a LiFePO4-based paper-cathode. This unravels the possibility of implementing the newly elaborated paper separators in safe, green and cost effective energy storage devices especially as they are obtained by rapid, low-cost and eco-friendly water-based paper-making techniques.","3820":"Mechanoluminescent (ML) materials, which luminesce in response to mechanical stimuli, are attractive candidates in developing energy-sustainable technology and are widely used in sensors, ubiquitous tight sources, and displays. Metal-doped zinc sulphide (ZnS) is considered a promising ML material because it produces intense and lasting luminescence under repeated mechanical stresses. Previous studies of ZnS luminescence have focused on single-channel emission by electroluminescence (EL) or ML generated by applied electric fields or mechanical stresses, respectively. Here, we report the simultaneous generation of EL and ML from an elastomeric ZnS composite embedded with silver nanowires and demonstrate the independent control of both EL and ML responses. We describe the tuning of the strength and color of the EL\/ML emissions from a single ZnS-based structure by applying combinations of electrical and mechanical excitation forces. We also demonstrate a multi-color-patterned EL\/ML emitting display using the ZnS-based composite; this application may provide a basis for the development of new optomechanical displays.

A simple mixing of PC liposomes and silica (SiO2) surface results in liposome fusion with the surface and formation of supported lipid bilayers. However, the stability of this bilayer is relatively low because adsorption is based mainly on weak van der Waals force. PC lipids strongly adsorb by TiO2, via chemical bonding with the lipid phosphate. The lack of fusion on TiO2 is attributable to the steric effect from the choline group in PC. In this study, inverse phosphocholine lipids (CP) are used, directly exposing the phosphate. Using a calcein leakage assay and cryo-TEM, fusion of CP liposome with TiO2 is demonstrated. The stability of this supported bilayer is significantly higher than that of the PC\/SiO2 system, as indicated by washing the membrane under harsh conditions. Adsorption of CP liposomes by TiO2 is inhibited at high pH. Interestingly, the CP liposome cannot fuse with silica surface because of a strong charge repulsion. This study demonstrates an interesting interplay between a soft matter surface and metal oxides. By tuning the lipid structure, it is possible to rationally control the interaction force. This study provides an alternative system for forming stable supported bilayers on TiO2, and represents the first example of interfacing inverse lipids with inorganic surfaces.","5806":"1,3-Di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-1,1-diphenylphosphinamine (2) was prepared from 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-imine (1) and chlorodiphenylphosphine. Compound 2 was treated further with elemental sulfur, selenium, and tellurium to afford the corresponding chalcogenide derivatives, 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-P,P-diphenyl-phosphinothioicamide (4), 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-P,P-diphenyl-phosphinoselenoicamide (5), and 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-P,P-diphenyl-phosphinotelluroicamide (6) in good yield. 1,3-Di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-P,P-diphenylphosphinicamide (3) was obtained by dissolving compound 2 in hydrochloric acid solution in THF. The corresponding borane adduct, 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazolin-2-ylidine-P,P-diphenyl-phosphinaminoborane (7) was isolated by the reaction of compound 2 and sodium borohydride in good yield. The molecular structures of compounds 2 and 4-7 were established by X-ray diffraction analyses. To analyse the electronic structure of chalcogenides of imidazolin-2-imine ligands, the protonation energies of the oxygen, sulfur, and selenide derivative of ligand 2 were calculated by means of density functional theory. Finally, the charge distribution in compounds 3, 4, and 5 were determined using natural bond orbital analysis.","3837":"We have proposed a kind of environment-friendly biological carbon fiber material derived from ramie for supercapacitor application. MnO2 nanoflakes were electrochemically grown on the ramie derived carbon fibers (RCFs) with a PEDOT conductive polymer wrapping layer uniformly coated on the flake surface to enhance the electrochemical performance. Benefited from the ultrahigh electron transmission rate of the RCFs backbone, high capacitive activity of MnO2, impressive electrical conductivity of PEDOT film and synergistic effect among above three components, the hybrid electrode displayed a high specific capacitance with 922 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and remarkable rate capability with capacitance retention of 345 F g(-1) at even 40 A g(-1). An extremely flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device based on the hybrid electrode was fabricated. It exhibited outstanding energy output efficiency (delivered an energy density of 19.17 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 500 W kg(-1)), high capacity retention rate (the capacity still retained 83% over 10000 cycles) and remarkable flexibility, showing its attractive prospect in wearable electronics and sustainable energy application.","3995":"Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) form by mixing polycation and polyanion solutions together, and have been explored for a variety of applications. One challenge for PEC processing and application is that under certain conditions the as-formed PECs aggregate and precipitate out of suspension over the course of minutes to days. This aggregation is governed by several factors such as electrostatic repulsion, van der Waals attractions, and hydrophobic interactions. In this work, we explore the boundary between colloidally stable and unstable complexes as it is influenced by polycation\/polyanion mixing ratio and ionic strength. The polymers examined are poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDAC) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS). Physical properties such as turbidity, hydrodynamic size, and zeta potential are investigated upon complex formation. We also perform detailed molecular dynamics simulations to examine the structure and effective charge distribution of the PECs at varying mixing ratios and salt concentrations to support the experimental findings. The results suggest that the colloidally stable\/unstable boundary possibly marks the screening effects from added salt, resulting in weakly charged complexes that aggregate. At higher salt concentrations, the complexes initially form and then gradually dissolve into solution.","2157":"A composite coating composed of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA) as an underlayer and polycaprolactone (PCL) as an overlayer was fabricated on an Mg-1.2Ca-2Zn alloy via combination of chemical solution deposition and dip coating methods. The overlayer was composed of a pore network structure with thickness around 38 mu m but the underlayer consisted of plate-like crystals with inner dense layer (1.2 mu m) and an outer coarse layer (6 mu m). The corrosion current densities of Mg alloy significantly decreased after composite coating from 211.6 to 0.059 mu A\/cm(2). Hence, the PCL\/OCP\/HA composite coating can effectively protect the Mg-1.2Ca-2Zn alloy when used as degradable orthopaedic implants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Strategies to disrupt the structure of crystallised lipid in aqueous solution at lower temperatures are much needed, where nanoparticle-based strategies show enormous promise. Using the aqueous tristearin bilayer as a model for crystallised lipid, we demonstrate that the synergistic use of surfactant and detonation nanodiamonds can depress the onset temperature at which disruption of the crystallised lipid structure occurs. Our simulations reveal the molecular-scale mechanisms by which this disruption takes place, indicating that the nanodiamonds serve a dual purpose. First, the nanodiamonds are predicted to facilitate delivery of surfactant to the lipid\/water interface, and second, nanodiamond adsorption acts to roughen the lipid\/water interface, enhancing ingress of surfactant into the bilayer. We find the balance of the hydrophobic surface area of the nanodiamond and the nanodiamond surface charge density to be a key determinant of the effectiveness of using nanodiamonds to facilitate lipid disruption. For the nanodiamond size considered here, we identify a moderate surface charge density, that ensures the nanodiamonds are neither too hydrophobic nor too hydrophilic, to be optimal.","5666":"Analytical application of immobilised enzyme system is mainly in biosensors. Meeting the demand for practical, cost effective and portable analytical devices, enzyme based biosensors have enormous potential applications in clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, bioprocess and food quality control, biomedical and pharmaceutical analysis. Tyrosinase is one of the most extensively studied enzymes for applications in enzyme based biosensors. Since immobilisation of enzyme is crucial for the construction and performance of biosensors, the present overview focuses on functional materials for the development of tyrosinase based biosensors. A short description of how electrochemical sensors are more advantageous for the detection of phenolic compounds is given, followed by sources of tyrosinase and electrode material used in tyrosinase based sensors. Various approaches to biosensor construction with respect to tyrosinase immobilisation, e.g. sol-gel techniques, self-assembled architectures, synthetic, conducting and biopolymers, nanomaterials, are also presented. The review intends to highlight immobilisation strategies in developing tyrosinase based biosensors.","5385":"The single crystal X-ray analysis of the ester-functionalized 2-oxazoline, methyl 3-(4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)propanoate, revealed -electron delocalization along the N-C-O segment in the 2-oxazoline pentacycle to significant extent, which is comparable to its counterpart along the O-C-O segment in the ester. Quantum chemical calculations based on the experimental X-ray geometry of the molecule supported the conjecture that the N-C-O segment has a delocalized electronic structure similar to an ester group. The calculated bond orders were 1.97 and 1.10 for the N=C and C-O bonds, and the computed partial charges for the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of -0.43 and -0.44 were almost identical. In the ester group, the bond orders were 1.94 and 1.18 for the C-O bonds, while the partial charges of the oxygen atom are -0.49 and -0.41, which demonstrates the similar electronic structure of the N-C-O and O-C-O segments. In 2-oxazolines, despite the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom (compared to the nitrogen atom), the charges of the hetero atoms oxygen and nitrogen are equalized due to the delocalization, and it also means that a cationic attack on the nitrogen is possible, enabling regioselectivity during the initiation of the cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-oxazoline monomers, which is a prerequisite for the synthesis of materials with well-defined structures.","5677":"BACKGROUNDThe kaolin flocculant activities of bovine blood (BB) and hemoglobin (HEM) at different salt and pH values were determined. Lower limit concentration (LLC), window of application (WA), and degrees of clarification (DC) values for BB and HEM were determined and compared with those of the synthetic polymeric flocculants poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), cationic polyacrylamide (PAM), and anionic PAM. BB flocculation of lignin, a bioproduct of biomass conversion to bioethanol, was demonstrated. RESULTSFlocculation of kaolin by BB and HEM increased at acidic pH and in the presence of NaCl. LLC values of HEM and BB were similar to LLC values of cationic and anionic PAM. LLC values of HEM and BB were 18-20-fold higher than that of PDDMAC. WA values of BB and HEM were similar to those of PDADMAC, cationic PAM, and anionic PAM. For lignin flocculation, the ratio of LLC for BB\/PDADMAC was 20-38, but the ratio of WA for BB\/PDADMAC was > 3.6. For kaolin and lignin flocculation, DC values were similar for all flocculants. CONCLUSIONSThe renewable flocculants BB and HEM rapidly settle kaolin and lignin suspensions; BB and HEM could be used in the process to separate lignin from other biomass components. Published 2014.

Although the structure is roughly the same, experimental results show very different behaviour between fluid-solid and air-solid phononic plates, due to most of the properties of the fluid-solid perforated plates rely on Fabry-Perot resonances, Wood anomalies and Lamb modes. In air-solid phononic plates Fabry-Perot resonance is highly attenuated due to impedances difference between air and water, and therefore some transmission modes are now distinguishable due to surface modes coupling.","5729":"In this work, we report exclusive separation of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) from a solution where this protein was present with beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) in 1 : 0.75 (w\/v) ratio at their common isoelectric pH (5 +\/- 0.02). A polyampholytic polypeptide Gelatin B (GB) also having the same pI was used to extract protein (BSA or beta-Lg) molecules selectively from this solution through a process called complex coacervation. In our study, the protein-rich condensate, called coacervate, comprised of GB-BSA complexes while the supernatant mostly contained beta-Lg molecules. For the separation of BSA from BSA-GB coacervate, we used ethyl alcohol, which removed the BSA to the supernatant. The differential binding affinity of BSA versus beta-Lg to GB chains was established through fluorescence quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies. The BSA-GB binding protocol followed a surface selective patch binding mechanism and these results were obtained from an array of experimental methods such as UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), FTIR and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Herein, it is clearly established that selective coacervation at pI can be used as a method for protein separation.","773":"In this study, we report a facile, environmental friendly route to synthesize water-insoluble beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)\/graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite hydrogels. These nanocomposite hydrogels were synthesized by in situ melt polymerization; first, the beta-CD was covalently bound to GO to produce beta-CD\/GO, and then beta-CD\/rGO was obtained through in situ reduction of GO by hydrazine. These hybrid materials were polycondensed in the presence of melted citric acid (CT) as a crosslinker. The structures of the obtained macromolecules were characterized by ATR-FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, DTG, DSC, DDSC, XRD, FE-SEM, EDAX, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and also by determining the amount of acidic groups and by adsorption of cationic methylene blue. These data have confirmed that beta-CD\/GO or rGO was effectively polymerized using CT through ester linkages. Swelling ratio data shows the ability of these nanocomposites to absorb a large amount of water in their structures, and the beta-CD polymer\/rGO (CDP-CT\/rGO) gels have higher equilibrium swelling ratios than the corresponding beta-CD polymer (CDP-CT) and CDP-CT\/GO. The results of cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry electrochemical studies revealed that CDP-CT\/GO and CDP-CT\/rGO nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited higher electrochemical responses toward dopamine, tyrosine and uric acid (biomolecules) than unmodified CDP-CT. In addition, CDP-CT\/rGO shows a higher response relative to CDP-CT\/GO, which is probably due to the restoration of the graphitic network after the reduction of GO. As a result, the improved electrochemical behaviors of these nanocomposites are due to a combination of the chemical properties of beta- CD, GO or rGO nanosheets, polyester and poly(carboxylic acid).","6928":"To meet the demands of high efficient microwave absorption materials, cobalt superstructure was synthesized and characterized. As SEM confirmed, the cobalt superstructure was assembled by flakes. The size of cobalt superstructure was about 10 mu m, and the thickness of the flake was about 500 nm. The permittivity and permeability were investigated as a function of frequency in the microwave range of 118 GHz. Based on the LLG equation and exchange resonance mode, three magnetic resonances, including one natural resonance and two exchange resonances were discussed. The calculated reflection loss (RL) indicated the cobalt superstructure indicated the cobalt superstructure has potential application as a promising candidate for microwave absorption. The maximum RL reached as high as -77.29 dB with a matching thickness of 1.5 mm, and the effective bandwidth with a reflection loss less than -10 dB was 3.6 GHz from 9.85 to 13.45 GHz. For cobalt superstructure, magnetic loss mainly contributed even more than dielectric loss to the microwave absorption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, macroporous structured graphene thin films (MGTFs) are fabricated on various substrates including flexible graphene papers (GPs) through an ice-crystal-induced phase separation process. The MGTFs prepared on GPs (MGTF@GPs) are recognized with remarkable features such as interconnected macroporous configuration, sufficient exfoliation of the conductive RGO sheets, and good mechanical flexibility. As such, the flexible MGTF@GPs are demonstrated as a versatile conductive platform for depositing conducting polymers (CPs), e.g., polyaniline (PAn), polypyrrole, and polythiophene, through in situ electropolymerization. The contents of the CPs in the composite films are readily controlled by varying the electropolymerization time. Notably, electrodeposition of PAn leads to the formation of nanostructures of PAn nanofibers on the walls of the macroporous structured RGO framework (PAn@MGTF@GPs): thereafter, the PAn@MGTF@GPs display a unique structural feature that combine the nanostructures of PAn nanofibers and the macroporous structures of RGO sheets. Being used as binder-free electrodes for flexible supercapacitors, the PAn@MGTF@GPs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, in particular a high areal specific capacity (538 mF cm(-2)), high cycling stability, and remarkable capacitive stability to, deformation, due to the unique electrode structures.","6730":"Silver nanofibers (Ag NFs) have attracted considerable attention for their potential applications in transparent electrodes to replace indium tin oxide (ITO). One of the key factors for hindering the performance of transparent electrodes is the junction resistance between nanofibers. Here, we combine an electrospinning method and electroless deposition to fabricate a Ag NFs transparent conducting electrode (TCE). Ultra-long PVDF\/SnCl2 nanofibers were firstly fabricated onto a flexible substrate as the template of Ag TCE. Subsequently, electroless deposition was adopted to deposit Ag onto the nanofiber template to decrease the junction resistance. The morphology and composition of the Ag NFs are systematically analyzed. The as-fabricated Ag TCE shows a conductivity of 73.55 Omega square(-1) and 15.35 Omega square(-1) (transmittance of 84% and 75%) and maintains its conductive properties even after 100 bending cycles. Importantly, the figure of merit F = T-10\/R-s, Omega square(-1), commonly used to evaluate the performance of transparent conducting electrodes, calculated for our Ag NF TCE is 2.3 X 10(-3) Omega square(-1) (T similar to 84%, Rs similar to 73.55 Omega square(-1)). This value is much higher than that of other transparent electrodes, such as SWCNT (similar to 0.8 X 10(-3) Omega square(-1)), graphene (similar to 0.3 X 10-3 Omega square(-1)), Ni film (similar to 0.7 X 10-3 Omega square(-1)). In addition, this Ag NFs transparent electrode is fabricated under ambient temperature and applicable to various substrates. Our results present a facile method for fabricating a TCE with relatively low Ag materials cost and reducing the junction resistance between nanofibers.","3964":"Fullerene, C-60, and its derivatives, have been fully investigated and commercialized. The importance of large carbon cage-based fullerenes for biomedical applications was gradually recognized due to their fantastic biological effects. In nanotoxicology, the key detection techniques are able to retain the intrinsic structure and properties of nanomaterials in a biological background. However, there were puzzling questions regarding how to facilely obtain detectable fullerene nanomaterials and their formation process. In this study, C-13-enriched fullerenes of a large carbon cage, C-70, were synthesized on a large scale from a C-13-enriched raw carbon material by an arc-discharge method. The stable isotope C-13 was directly incorporated into the skeleton of the fullerene cages without destroying their intrinsic structures. The isotopic effects of C-13-labeled C-70 were investigated in detail. The amount of C-13 labelling of C-70 was about 7% higher than that of the natural abundance, which greatly improved the C-13 detection signal in isotope ratio mass spectrometry and gave an apparent 8-fold carbon nuclear magnetic resonance signal enhancement for the fullerenes. The C-13-enriched fullerenes showed significant isotopic effects, such as the strongest peak position shifting up (m\/z > 840) and the Poisson distribution of the isotopic peaks in the mass spectra, and the migration or splitting of infrared and Raman characteristic peaks. When comparing the C-13 labelling amounts and the isotopic effects of C-13-enriched C-70 and those of C-13-enriched C-60, the formation dynamics of the fullerenes were different with different carbon cages; lower carbon cage fullerenes were easily generated in the arc-discharge process, and the C-13 stable isotopic effects in high carbon fullerenes were also slightly weak. Moreover, these important isotopic effects of the C-13-enriched fullerenes will facilitate the development of new analytical methods for carbon nanomaterials in vivo.","4763":"The direct growth of complex ternary metal oxides on three-dimensional conductive substrates is highly desirable for improving the electrochemical performance of lithium -ion batteries(LIBs).

Moreover, the size of the ZCO nanocubes was adjusted by the quantity of urea used in the hydrothermal process. Serving as a binder -free anode material for LIBs, the ZnCo2O4\/CNFs composite prepared- using 1.0 mmol of urea (ZCO\/CNFs-10) exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability, and good rate capability. More specifically, a high reversible capacity of -600 mAh CI was obtained at a current density of 0.5 degrees C following 300 charge -discharge cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance could be associated with the controllable size of the ZCO nanocubes and synergistic effects between ZCO and the CNFs.","1758":"Novel nanostructured silicon composites, Si\/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanowire network (Si\/PNW) and Si\/(S-doped-carbon nanowire network) (Si\/S-CNW), are prepared by a soft-template polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant with the presence of Si nanoparticles and a subsequent carbonization of Si\/PNW, respectively. The presence of Si nanoparticles in the soft-template polymerization of EDOT plays a critical role in the formation of PEDOT nanowire network instead of 1D nanowire. After the carbonization of PEDOT, the S-doped-carbon nanowire network matrix shows higher electrical conductivity than PNW counterpart, which facilitates to construct robust conductive bridges between Si nanoparticles and provide large electrode\/electrolyte interfaces for rapid charge transfer reactions. Thus, Si\/S-CNW composite exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capability as anode material, retaining a specific capacity of 820 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles with a very small capacity fade of 0.09% per cycle.

Among the samples, the one activated at 800 degrees C (NHCA-800) exhibits the highest specific surface area of 1778 m(2) g(-1) and the best electrochemical performance as both the electrode for a supercapacitor and the electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction, which is due to the co-existence of large amount of micro- and mesopores in NHCA-800.","251":"A carbon matrix with an appropriate porous structure plays a vital role in developing high-performance sulfur\/carbon cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, a hierarchical porous carbon fiber (HPCF) with a few mesopores and abundant micropores was prepared via electrospinning with a SiO2 template and subsequent KOH activation. The HPCF with an ultra-high surface area and a large pore volume can construct a loose network structure to promise high sulfur utilization and sufficient sulfur loading. Mesopores can provide pathways for the infiltration of electrolyte to ensure fast transport of lithium ions during electrochemical reactions, whereas micropores can effectively suppress the diffusion of polysulfides by their strong adsorption capability. Due to such advantages, the proposed cathode, with 66 wt% sulfur content, can yield a high reversible capacity of 1070.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, and a stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 88.4% after 100 cycles.","4674":"We report on paramagnetic shifts identified in O-17, Mg-25, and Ca-43 NMR spectra of CaO and MgO doped with 0.3-2.2 mol % NiO or CoO. Systematically shifted features were identified for both paramagnetic dopants (Ni2+ or Co2+) and both bulk materials (CaO and MgO), and in some cases spectral features could be assigned to paramagnetic cations at specific sites within five bonds of the observed nucleus. We compare the empirical peak areas to theoretically derived peak areas expected under conditions of random mixing and observe that Ni2+ - and Co2+-doped MgO systems agree well with random mixing but doped CaO systems do not. In spite of the very low natural isotopic abundances of O-17 and Ca-43, moderate natural abundance of Mg-25, and relatively low Larmor frequencies of all three nuclides, the cubic crystal structures and the resulting narrow NMR peaks allowed a first look at the potential of investigating dopant cation distributions in group 2 oxides though NMR.","1643":"An efficient water splitting electrocatalyst is presented. Cheap and sustainable cellulose filter paper, infiltrated with nickel acetate as the nickel source, and phenanthroline as a ligand and nitrogen source are carbonized together. Nitrogen functionalities turn out to be crucial coordination sites for the supported Ni\/NiO(OH) particles. This simple and scalable one step procedure leads to powders, but also to complete membranes made of approximate to 10 wt% Ni, supported on nitrogen functionalized carbon. The non-noble catalyst shows a low onset potential (330 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode), high current density (e.g., j > 25 mA cm(-2) at = 430 mV), excellent kinetics (Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1)), and a very favorable stability (<5% decay after 10 h electrolysis) in the oxygen evolution. The performance is similar or even better compared to state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts (e.g., IrO2, Ir\/C, Ru\/C, and Pt\/C). Because of the simple, cheap, and scalable preparation procedure the catalyst is highly promising for practical low price\/tech applications. Interestingly, the system is also active in the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to a promising bifunctional catalyst. The benchmark characteristics are (10) = 390 mV for oxygen evolution and (10) = 190 mV for hydrogen evolution, that is, an overall efficiency of 68% at 10 mA current density.","2306":"The Na+\/H+ antiporters transport sodium (or several other monovalent cations) in exchange for H+ across lipid bilayers in all kingdoms of life. They are critical in the pH homeostasis of cytoplasm and\/or organelles. In humans, these proteins are associated with the pathophysiology of various diseases. Yet, the most extensively studied Na+\/H+ antiporter is Ec-NhaA, the main Na+\/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli. The crystal structure of an inactive, down-regulated Ec-NhaA, determined at acidic pH, has provided the first structural insights into the antiport mechanism and pH regulation of an Na+\/H+ antiporter. It reveals a unique structural fold (called the NhaA fold) in which helical transmembrane segments (TMs) are organized in inverted-topology repeats, including two antiparallel non-helical extended chain regions that cross each other, forming a delicate electrostatic balance in the middle of the membrane. The NhaA fold contributes to the cation binding site and facilitates rapid conformational changes of Ec-NhaA. The NhaA fold has now been recognized to be shared by four Na+\/H+ antiporters (bacterial and archaeal) and two Na+ symporters. Thus far, no crystal structure of any of the human Na+\/H+ antiporters has been determined. Nevertheless, the Ec-NhaA crystal structure has enabled the structural modeling of NHE1, NHE9, and NHA2, which are involved in human pathophysiology. Future elucidation of structure-function relationships of eukaryotic and prokaryotic Na+\/H+ antiporters are likely to provide insights into the human pathophysiology. Here, we will focus on the NhaA structural fold which underpins the antiporter functionality of Ec-NhaA and the secondary active transporters.","2934":"Novel silicon nanoparticle\/porous carbon nanofiber (Si\/PCNF) hybrids with high Si loading (52 wt.%) have been designed and fabricated through a simple electrospinning. The Si\/PCNF of uniform fiber diameter has exhibited high specific surface area and unique porous structure. The continuous three-dimensional porous carbon networks have effectively provided strain relaxation for Si volume expansion\/shrinkage during lithium insertion\/extraction. In addition, the carbon matrix could largely minimize the direct exposure of Si to the electrolyte, thus substantially improving the structural stability of Si. Moreover, the porous structure could also create efficient channels for the fast transport of lithium ions. As a consequence, this novel Si-based hybrid material has exhibited stable cycling performance ( ca. 870 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 100 cycles) in the absence of binders and conducting additives, promising great potential as a free-standing anode for lithium ion batteries.

Homogeneous alkoxycarbonylation of cellulose was accomplished by applying dialkycarbonates (dimethyl and diethyl carbonate) in the ionic liquid-electrolyte trioctylphosphonium acetate ([P-8881] [OAc])\/DMSO or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([emim] [OAc]). Cellulose dialkylcarbonates with a moderate degree of substitution (DS similar to 1) are accessible via this procedure and cellulose methylcarbonate was thoroughly characterized for its chemical and physical properties after regeneration. This included HSQC & HMBC NMR, ATR-IR, molecular weight distribution, morphology, thermal properties, and barrier properties after film formation.","408":"A facile method to prepare the nanoporous and graphene-like carbon material from a natural silk fiber was developed by a potassium intercalation and carbonization procedure. The as-synthesized graphene-like fiber was employed for oxygen reduction reaction and exhibited impressive electrocatalytic activity.","457":"As electromagnetic pollution is becoming more and more serious, novel composite microwave absorbents are gaining much attention. In this work, low-cost glucose was used as a carbon source to prepare hydrochar, and Fe-Fe3C\/C microspheres for microwave absorption were successfully synthesized through the hydrothermal synthesis of Fe3O4\/hydrochar and subsequent high-temperature carbonization at different temperatures. The results showed that the Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles were uniformly loaded on the carbon microspheres. Resulting from the synergistic effect of Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles and partially graphitized carbon, a wide region of microwave absorption was achieved due to dual dielectric and magnetic losses. An effective bandwidth of reflection loss less than -10 dB could reach up to 4 GHz with 1.5 mm thickness. Owing to the characteristics of the cost-effective synthetic route, low density and good microwave absorption with thin thickness, the Fe-Fe3C\/C microspheres could be used as a lightweight and highly efficient microwave absorbent.","1569":"We describe the production of graphene-based composites for energy storage, obtained by a combination of electrochemical and solution processing techniques. Electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxide sheets (EGO) are produced using an original setup that allows fast expansion of graphite flakes and efficient exfoliation of expanded graphite via an electrochemical route. The sheets are deposited on a sacrificial nickel foam together with an iron hydroxide colloidal precursor. Calcination treatment simultaneously renders the EGO foam conductive and transforms Fe(OH)(3) into hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), yielding a nanoporous Fe2O3 layer on the surface of the mesoporous EGO foam, creating an ideal structure for lithium storage. The obtained graphene\/metal oxide hybrid is a continuous, electrically conductive three-dimensional (3D) composite featuring a hierarchical meso-nano porous structure. A systematic study of these composites, varying the Fe2O3:EGO ratio, is then performed to maximize their performance as nanostructured electrodes in standard coin cell batteries.

To investigate the effects of the chemical structures on their properties and microstructures, polyimide aerogels produced using hybrid diamines with different rigidity are evaluated. It is found that polyimide aerogels with rigid building blocks (PI-RBs) have a density in the range of 0.245 to 0.300 g cm(-3) depending on the uncontrollable shrinkage (27-36%), and high Young's modulus of 50-76 MPa. While polyimide aerogels with flexible building blocks (PI-FBs) exhibit lower shrinkage of 8-15%, lower density ranging from 0.124 to 0.172 g cm(-3), and a lower modulus of 28-34 MPa. Their various performances are closely related to the nanostructure difference between the particulate PI-FBs and the fibrous PI-RBs. The diverse morphology has been attributed to the different rigidities of their repeat units. Over all, the obtained polyimide aerogels are all excellent high-temperature thermal insulation materials with low thermal conductivity of 0.033-0.049 W (mK)(-1) at room temperature and 5% weight loss temperature at about 550 degrees C in N-2.","1046":"Direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) is a high temperature fuel cell using solid carbon as fuel. The use of environmentally friendly carbon material constitutes a promising option for the DCFC future. In this context, this paper focuses on the use of biomass-derived charcoal renewable fuel. A practical investigation of Tunisian olive wood charcoal (OW-C) in planar DCFCs is conducted and good power density (105 mW cm(-2)) and higher current density (550 mA cm(-2)) are obtained at 700 degrees C. Analytical and predictive techniques are performed to explore the relationships between fuel properties and DCFC chemical and electrochemical mechanisms. High carbon content, carbon oxygen groups and disordered structure, are the key parameters allowing the achieved good performance. Relatively complex chain reactions are predicted to explain the gas evolution within the anode. CO, H-2 and CH4 participation in the anodic reaction is proved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The synthetic strategy involves the fabrication of multilayer chitosan (CS)\/polyacrylic acid (PAA) film with a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique, followed by immersing the resulting CS\/PAA PEM film in a cobalt chloride solution. According to the theory calculation and experimental results, cobalt chloride annealing treatment plays a critical role in rebuilding the reversible interactions that facilitate the PEM film to heal the mechanical damages and endow the PEM film with the property of reversibly changing its color in different conditions of humidity. Such a metal induced, humidity responsive, self-healing PEM film may broaden the application of the self-healing materials.","7046":"Over the past few years, bio-succinic acid from renewable resources has gained increasing attention as a potential bio-derived platform chemical for the detergent\/surfactant, ion chelator, food and pharmaceutical markets. Until now, much research was undertaken to lower the production costs of bio-succinic acid, however a multicriteria sustainability evaluation of established and upcoming production processes from a technical perspective is still lacking in the scientific literature. In this study, we combine metabolic engineering with the most mature technologies for the production of bio-succinic acid from sugar beet and lignocellulosic residues. Downstream technologies such as reactive extraction, electrodialysis and ion exchange are investigated together with different upstream technologies such as neutral pH level-, acidic- and high sugar fermentation including metabolically engineered E. coli strains. Different biorefinery concepts are evaluated considering technical, economic, environmental and process hazard aspects in order to gain a broad sustainability perspective of the technologies. The results reveal that energy integration is a key factor for biorefinery concepts in order to be economically reasonable and to achieve lower environmental impacts compared to the conventional production from non-renewable resources. It was found that metabolically engineered E. coli with resistance at the acidic pH level in the fermentation together with reactive extraction in the purification presents the most environmentally competitive technology. However, E. coli strains with resistance at high sugar concentrations together with reactive extraction are revealed to present the most economically competitive technology for the production of bio-succinic acid. Moreover, both technologies are flagged for higher process hazards and require the right measures to enhance process safety and mitigate environmental loads and worker exposure.","1352":"Nanostructured components have been receiving considerable attention in recent years. One advantage is the use of near-field electrospinning (NFES) in microdevice manufacture. Multi-nozzle NFES is offered as a technique to increase the high-precision production rate of components. The deposition characteristics of the multi-nozzles were observed and analyzed based on the mutual influence of the jets under varied conditions. It was discovered that the mutual distance of deposition becomes larger with increases in working distance and nozzle spacing, but the influence of voltage is not particularly apparent. This paper discusses the results and conclusions of the experimental investigation and theoretical derivation. (C) 2014 Author(s).

It is also thought to play a key role in cell signaling processes associated with functional plasma membrane microdomains (domains enriched in cholesterol), commonly referred to as rafts. In all of these diverse biological phenomena, the transverse location of cholesterol in the membrane is almost certainly an important structural feature. Using a combination of neutron scattering and solid-state H-2 NMR, we have determined the location and orientation of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine (PC) model membranes having fatty acids of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation. The data establish that cholesterol reorients rapidly about the bilayer normal in all the membranes studied, but is tilted and forced to span the bilayer midplane in the very thin bilayers. The possibility that cholesterol lies flat in the middle of bilayers, including those made from PC lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is ruled out. These results support the notion that hydrophobic thickness is the primary determinant of cholesterol's location in membranes.","786":"Composite anion-exchange membranes were prepared using sol-gel techniques with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and anion-exchange silica precursor (AESP). Ammonium functionality was created on the AESP through a ring opening reaction between 2-(3-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane and glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride under mild heating conditions. The resulting membranes were subjected to physico-chemical investigations using various techniques. The pervaporation performance of the membranes was systematically investigated based on the effects of feed composition and the mass% of AESP. Among the membranes studied, the membranes containing 4 mass% of AESP exhibited the highest separation factor of 2991 with a flux of 10.76 x 10(-2) kg m(-2) h(-1) at 30 degrees C for 10 mass% of water in the feed. The trade-off phenomenon which exists between the flux and the separation factors was overcome by the incorporation of AESP in PVA matrix. We find that the overlap between the total flux and flux of water, suggests that these membranes could be used effectively to break the azeotropic point of water-isopropanol mixtures. From the temperature dependent diffusion and permeation values, the Arrhenius activation parameters were estimated. The E-p and E-D values ranged between 18.36 and 7.94, and 18.68 and 8.09 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The negative heat of sorption (Delta H-s) values was obtained for all the membranes, indicating that Langmuir's mode of sorption is predominant in the transport process.","3570":"A rechargeable aluminum battery is considered as a promising battery system used in energy storage devices, due to its natural abundance and high capacity. However, fabrication of this battery working at room temperature did not succeed until haloaluminate containing ionic liquids were used as electrolytes. Therefore, anions are expected to have a great effect on performance of rechargeable aluminum batteries. For a complete understanding of the anion-effect, haloaluminate containing ionic liquids prepared with different halogenated imidazole salt and AlCl3\/imidazolium chloride mole ratios are studied. The electrochemical window is found to narrow with reducibility of halide ions, which is confirmed by calculation results using the density functional theory (DFT) method. For ionic liquids at different mole ratios, the coexistence of different chloroaluminate anions (Cl-, AlCl4-, Al2Cl7-) is found. When used as an electrolyte in a rechargeable aluminum battery with a V2O5 nanowire cathode, the AlCl3\/[BMIM] Cl ionic liquid with the mole ratio of 1.1 : 1 shows the best performance. The as-assembled cell exhibits a high discharge voltage platform (1 V) and capacity (288 mA h g(-1)) at the first cycle. Concentration of Al2Cl7- is considered as a key factor in chloroaluminate ionic liquids when used as electrolytes. Furthermore, a slight corrosion is found on the surface of Al metal foil immersed in an AlCl3\/[BMIM]Cl = 1.1 : 1 ionic liquid for 24 h, which may help remove the oxide film on the Al metal foil, so as to improve the charge\/discharge performance.","79":"We describe the creation of polymeric micro capsules that can exhibit autonomous motion along defined trajectories. The capsules are made by cross-linking aqueous microdroplets of the biopolymer chitosan using glutaraldehyde. A coflow microfluidic tubing device is used to generate chitosan droplets containing nanoparticles (NPs) with an iron (Fe) core and a platinum (Pt) shell. The droplets are then incubated in a Petri dish with the cross-linking solution, and an external magnet is placed below the Petri dish to pull the NPs together as a collective \"patch\" on one end of each droplet. This results in cross-linked capsules (similar to 150 mu m in diameter) with an anisotropic (patchy) structure. When these capsules are placed in a solution of H2O2, the Pt shell of the NPs catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 into O-2 gas, which is ejected from the patchy end in the form of bubbles. As a result, the capsules (which are termed micromotors) move in a direction opposite to the bubbles. Furthermore, the micromotors can be steered along specific paths by an external magnet (the magnetic response arises due to the Fe in the core of the NPs). A given micromotor can thus be directed to meet with and adhere to an inert capsule, i.e., a model cargo. Adhesion occurs due to the soft nature of the two structures. Once the cargo is picked up, the micromotor-cargo pair can be moved along a specific path to a destination, whereupon the cargo can be released from the micromotor. We believe these soft micromotors offer significant benefits over their existing hard counterparts because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to encapsulate a variety of payloads.","3103":"Converting iron pyrite (FeS2) from a non-cyclable to a cyclable cathode material for lithium ion batteries has been an ongoing challenge in recent years. Herein we report a promising mitigation strategy: wet-chemistry based conformal encapsulation of synthetic FeS2 nanocrystals in a resilient carbon (RC) matrix (FeS2@RC). The FeS2@RC composite was fabricated by dispersing autoclave-synthesized FeS2 nanocrystals in an aqueous glucose solution, polymerizing the glucose in a hydrothermal reactor, and finally heating the polymer\/FeS2 composite in a tube furnace to partially carbonize the polymer. The FeS2@RC electrodes showed superior cyclability compared with the FeS2 electrodes, that is, 25% versus 1% of retention at the 20th cycle. Based on electrochemical analysis, XRD study, and SEM characterization, the performance enhancement was attributed to RC's ability to accommodate volume fluctuation, enhance charge transfer, alleviate detrimental side reactions, and suppress loss of the active material. Furthermore, the remaining issues associated with the current system were identified and future research directions were proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Exploration of an appropriate post-annealing process is significant to gain insight into the crystallization of solar materials. The earth-abundant Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) thin films were fabricated by post-sulfuring as-prepared precursors and the results have been compared with that of directed-annealed samples. It was found that the sulfurization procedure not only can support to enhance the crystallinity but also help to obtain a nearly stoichiometric CMTS thin film which also free of SnS secondary phase. This reaction also contributes to sustainable incorporation of S into CMTS to a considerable extent and formation of notable large grains; whereas, it leads to the formation of a typical bi-layer microstructure containing large grains (500-800 nm) on the top and fine grains at the bottom. Through the sulfurization approach, the device performance is improved with the power conversion efficiency shows a 170% increase which mainly via the boost of open circuit and fill factor compared with that of direct-annealed processed. These results offers a novel research direction for preparing pure-sulfide CMTS thin film for the potential application in low-cost solar cells. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

However, the conventional QSAR methods show difficulty in serving these purposes because a certain amount of molecular descriptors are difficult to be interpreted; however, they have low-cost and time-saving features. As such, mechanistically interpretable molecular descriptors were developed in this study in order to make the technique of the structure-activity relationship useful in the drug-action mechanism study. The structure-activity plots of the anthracycline anticancer activity (log GI(50)) against the mechanistically interpretable molecular descriptors: the polarizability (intercalation between the bases of DNA), the function in the dispersion interaction formula (passive diffusion through the lipid bilayers of cell membranes) and the energy change for the one-electron reduction (oxidative stress) were constructed. The descriptors were calculated by quantum chemical methods. The GI(50) values were obtained from the NCI-60 DTP human tumor cell line screen. This study shows that the intercalation strength and the passive diffusion rate dominantly contribute to cytotoxicity, but not the one-electron reduction according to the structure-activity plots. Therefore, the controversies of their contributions to cytotoxicity arising from the early experimental results are resolved. Moreover, the plots can describe how different chemical substituents affect anticancer activity. Also, the plots reveal that anthracyclines not only bearing morpholino and cyanomorpholino moieties and three-sugar-like units can behave with extraordinary anticancer activity, and the situations are more complicated than simply possessing them. Accordingly, the results challenge the current proposals for the design of anthracycline anticancer antibiotics, and reviewing the drug design strategies is necessary.","7294":"Furanic and phenolic compounds, formed during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, are problematic byproducts in down-stream biofuel processes. A microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is an alternative technology to handle furanic and phenolic compounds and produce renewable hydrogen (H-2). The present study evaluated the performance of a continuous-flow bioanode MEC fed with furanic and phenolic compounds at different operating conditions. All hydraulic retention times (HRTs) tested (6-24 h) resulted in complete transformation of the parent compounds at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.2 g L-1 per d and applied voltage of 0.6 V. Increasing the OLR to 0.8 g L-1 per d at an HRT of 6 h resulted in an increased H-2 production rate from 0.07 to 0.14 L L-anode(-1) per d, but an OLR of 3.2 g L-1 per d did not lead to a higher H-2 production rate. Significant methane production was observed at an OLR of 3.2 g L-1 per d. The lack of increased H-2 production at the highest OLR tested was due to a limited rate of exoelectrogenesis but not fermentation, evidenced by the accumulation of high acetate levels and higher growth of fermenters and methanogens over exoelectrogens. Increasing applied voltage from 0.6 to 1.0 V at an OLR of 3.2 g L-1 per d and HRT of 6 h enhanced exoelectrogenesis and resulted in a 1.7-fold increase of H-2 production. Under all operating conditions, more than 90% of the biomass was biofilm-associated. The present study provides new insights into the performance of continuous-flow bioelectrochemical systems fed with complex waste streams resulting from the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.","858":"We demonstrate the fabrication of a large-scale device allowing for electrical switching of polarized light with a polarization ratio of 0.45 over a 1.5 cm(2) area. To achieve this, silica-coated semiconductor nanorods were embedded in polymeric nanofibers by electrospinning. The uniaxial extensional flow experienced by the particles induces alignment of the nanorods within the nanofibers. A subsequent parallel alignment of the nanofibers themselves results in a large and flexible film of massively aligned nanorods that can conveniently be processed further. We demonstrate this by integrating the aligned nanofibers in a liquid crystal cell with a polarizer where applying a voltage allows switching the emitted light on and off.","3139":"The possibility to direct pharmacological treatments targeting specific cell lines using polymer nanoparticles is one of the main novelties and perspectives in nanomedicine. However, sometimes, the ability to maintain NPs localized at the site of the injection that work as a drug reservoir can represent a good and complementary option. In this direction we built a composite material made of polymeric hydrogel functionalized with polymer NPs. epsilon-caprolactone and polyethylene glycol have been copolymerized in a two-step synthesis of PEGylated NPs, while hydrogel was synthesized through polycondensation between NPs, agarose and branched polyacrylic acid. NP functionalization was verified with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high resolution magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (HRMAS-NMR) spectroscopy and release kinetics from a hydrogel matrix and compared with NPs only physically entrapped into a hydrogel matrix. The characteristics of the resulting composite hydrogel-NPs system were studied both in terms of rheological properties and in its ability to sustain the release of To-Pro3, used as a drug mimetic compound to represent a promising drug delivery device.","5360":"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether genome-wide levels of DNA methylation are associated with age and the health risks of obesity (HRO); defined according to BMI categories as Low HRO (overweight and class 1 obesity) versus High HRO (class 2 and class 3 obesity). Anthropometric measurements were assessed in a subsample of 48 volunteers from the Metabolic Syndrome Reduction in Navarra (RESMENA) study and 24 women from another independent study, Effects of Lipoic Acid and Eicosapentaenoic Acid in Human Obesity (OBEPALIP study). In the pooled population; the methylation levels of 55 CpG sites were significantly associated with age after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. In addition, DNA methylation of three CpG sites located in ELOVL2; HOXC4 and PI4KB were further negatively associated with their mRNA levels. Although no differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in relation to HRO after multiple testing correction; several nominally significant CpG sites were identified in genes related to insulin signaling; energy and lipid metabolism. Moreover, statistically significant associations between BMI or mRNA levels and two HRO-related CpG sites located in GPR133 and ITGB5 are reported. As a conclusion, these findings from two Spanish cohorts add knowledge about the important role of DNA methylation in the age-related regulation of gene expression. In addition; a relevant influence of age on DNA methylation in white blood cells was found, as well as, on a trend level, novel associations between DNA methylation and obesity.","4852":"In this work we present a data-driven approach to the rational design of battery materials based on both resource and performance considerations. A large database of Li-ion battery material has been created by abstracting information from over 200 publications. The database consists of over 16000 data points from various classes of materials. In addition to reference information, key parameters and variables determining the performance of batteries were collected. This work also includes resource considerations such as crustal abundance and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, a commonly used measure of market concentration. The data is organized into a free web-based resource where battery researchers can employ a unique visualization method to plot database parameters against one another. This contribution is concerned with cathode and anode electrode materials. Cathode materials are mostly based on an intercalation mechanism, while anode materials are primarily based on conversion and alloying. Results indicate that cathode materials follow a common trend consistent with their crystal structure. On the other hand anode materials display similar behavior, based on elemental composition. Of particular interest is that high energy cathodes are scarcer than high power materials and high performance anode materials are less available. More sustainable materials for both electrodes based on alternative compositions are identified.","6440":"Two new complexes [Co(NIPH)(bimb)(H2O)](n) (1) and [Ni(NIPH)(mbix)](n) (2) (H2NIPH = 5-nitroisophthalic acid, bimb = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)butane, mbix = 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene) have been hydrothermally synthesised and structurally characterised by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, UVspectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) network, which was stabilised through O-H center dot center dot center dot O and C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen-bonding interactions. Complex 2 shows a two-dimensional (2D) network structure, which was further extended into a three-dimensional supramolecular structure through C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions.

In order to obtain different micro configurations of the material reflected in different porosities, four different fuel agents were involved: citric acid, tartaric acid, cellulose and urea. XRD and XPS techniques were used to certify the composition. The influence of fuel agent and structural features on the electrical properties of ferrite sintered pellets was investigated at room temperature as a function of frequency and humidity. Because the electrical characteristics of a porous material can significantly affect by the humidity, the electrical measurements were carried out in controlled humidity environments. Conduction mechanism is explained in terms of fuel agent influence on phase composition, grain size value, cation distribution and induced strain within spinel lattice by dissolution of voluminous Dy3+ ions. The humidity sensors applicative characteristics of the material are highlight by analyzing the sensitivity, response and recovery times of nickel-zinc-dysprosium ferrite used as active material.","6480":"In recent years, significant research has aimed at developing environmentally friendly supercapacitors by introducing biopolymeric materials, such as polysaccharides or proteins. In addition to the sustainability and recyclability of such novel energy storage devices, these polymers also provide flexibility, lightweight nature and stable cycling performance, which are of tremendous importance for applications related to wearable electronics. Among the different sustainable natural polymers, cellulose deserves special consideration since it is the most abundant and is extensively recycled. Consequently, research on electrically active cellulose-based supercapacitors has noticeably increased since 2012, which makes this review on the field timely. Specifically, recent advances in preparing high performance cellulose supercapacitors are summarized. Moreover, the key roles of cellulose in improving the specific capacitance and cycling stability of cellulose-based devices are compiled to offer important fundamental guidelines for designing the next generation of all-cellulose energy storage devices that are to come. Finally, challenges and perspectives in this exciting area of study are also discussed.","5790":"Data are emerging that the recognition of foreign antigens by Toll\/like receptors (TLRs) was predominant in skin graft rejection. More interestingly, most of the TLRs recruit myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) as an adaptor during signaling transduction. Design of an efficient shRNA\/vector complex to suppress the expression of MyD88 protein seems to be a potential approach in preventing allorejection of skin. In this study, we prepared a complex composed of a MyD88-shRNA plasmid (pMyD88) and a cationic polymeric vector. The results showed that the pMyD88 and vectors with an optimal mass ratio (1 : 2) was selected by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) experiments; moreover, the cationic liposome vectors increased the transfection efficiency of naked pMyD88, and the gene transcription of MyD88 mRNA and expression of MyD88 protein was significantly suppressed by the pMyD88\/liposomes complex. Notably, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation test showed that the recognition of foreign antigen in DCs, which are treated with the pMyD88\/liposomes complex, was significantly inhibited. This attempt promises to solve skin allorejection problems in the future.","5204":"Novel carbon nanofibers with BiOBr and AgBr decoration have been prepared by a combination of electrospinning, carbonization and solvothermal treatments. BiOBr\/AgBr hybrids interweaved together and covered the carbon nanofibers to form a three-dimensional (3D) open porous structure. The resultant composite carbon nanofibers exhibited a high efficiency for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB in aqueous solution and were convenient to separate from water.","3870":"A three-dimensional (3D) carbonaceous aerogel derived from biomass bacterial cellulose (BC) is introduced as a flexible framework for iron oxides in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The 3D carbonized BC (CBC) with highly interconnected nanofibrous structure exhibits good electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The amorphous Fe2O3 is tightly coated on the nanofibers of CBC through a simple in situ thermal decomposition method. The obtained amorphous Fe2O3 anode (denoted as A-Fe2O3@CBC) exhibits stable cycling performance and high rate capability when assembled into a half-cell, which is supposed to benefit from the well-dispersed Fe2O3 nanoshells and the hierarchical pores in A-Fe2O3@CBC composite. The rational design of the nanostructure could improve the transportation of electrons\/ions and effectively alleviate volume changes of Fe2O3 during the electrochemical cycling. Meanwhile, the amorphous nature of the Fe2O3 in anode provides an enhanced capacitive-like lithium storage and flexible structure of the active materials, resulting in much higher specific capacity and longer cycle life when compared with its crystalline counterpart. This work provides a promising approach to design and construct the flexible metal oxide anode materials based on 3D carbonaceous aerogel for high-performance LIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These heterostructures are prepared by seed-mediated routes, where the structure, composition, and morphology of the CdSe nanocrystals used as a seed play key roles in directing the growth of the second semiconducting domain. The local structural environment of all the elements in the CdSe@CdS heterostructures was investigated at the Cd, S, and Se K-edges by taking advantage of the selectivity of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and was compared to pure reference compounds. We found that the structural features of dot@rods are independent of the size of the rods. These structures can be described as made of a CdSe dot and a CdS rod, both in the wurtzite phase with a high crystallinity of both the core and the rod. This result supports the effectiveness of high temperature colloidal synthesis in promoting the formation of core@shell nanocrystals with very low defectivity. On the other hand, data on the CdSe@CdS with octapod morphology suggest the occurrence of a core composed of a CdSe cubic sphalerite phase with eight pods made of CdS wurtzite phase. Our findings are compared to current models proposed for the design of functional heterostructures with controlled nanoarchitecture.","3244":"Three-dimensional (3D) graphene foams (GF) were grown on nickel foam by chemical vapor deposition method, and then flowerlike MoS2 nanosheets assembled on GF were achieved by single mode microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique. The flexible MoS2@GF electrode with high conductive network and interconnected channel shows excellent electrochemical performance for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). For LIBs, the specific capacity of MoS2@GF can reach up to 1400 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1), moreover, the high specific capacity (1127 mAh g(-1)) can be achieved at a rate of 250 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. In addition, the obtained specific capacity for SIBs after 50 cycles is 290 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 100 mA g(-1). The excellent performance of the flexible MoS2@GF electrode is attributed to fast electron transport, more efficient penetration of electrolyte and shortened ion diffusion time for high conductive, stable 3D architectures.

The significantly reduced spectral reflectivity of silicon nanowire to visible light makes it even more attractive in solar energy applications. However, the benefit of its use for solar thermal energy harvesting remains to be investigated and has so far not been clearly reported. The purpose of this study is to provide practical information and insight into the performance of silicon nanowires in solar thermal energy conversion systems. Spectral hemispherical reflectivity and transmissivity of the black silicon nanowire array on silicon wafer substrate were measured. It was observed that the reflectivity is lower in the visible range but higher in the infrared range compared to the plain silicon wafer. A drying experiment and a theoretical calculation were carried out to directly evaluate the effects of the trade-off between scattering properties at different wavelengths. It is clearly seen that silicon nanowires can improve the solar thermal energy harnessing. The results showed that a 17.8 % increase in the harvest and utilization of solar thermal energy could be achieved using a silicon nanowire array on silicon substrate as compared to that obtained with a plain silicon wafer.","3947":"As a representative natural polymer with abundant functionalities, humic acid was creatively explored as an anode material for lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries with high storage capacities, and satisfactory cycling stabilities. Most impressively, this work provides a promising and effective strategy for developing organic energy storage devices from natural sources.","6994":"The pK(a) of the p-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) ligands in the Au-102(pMBA)(44) nanocluster was measured by using acid base and IR titration. The observed macroscopic pK(a) = 6.18 +\/- 0.05 is significantly more basic than that of free pMBA (pK(a) = 4.16), and the protonation behavior is anticooperative according to the Hill coefficient n = 0.64 +\/- 0.04. The cluster is truly water-soluble when more than 22 and insoluble when fewer than 7 ligands are in the deprotonated state. In order to obtain more insight into the anticooperative character, the cluster was modeled at pH similar to 6.2 using constant pH molecular dynamics simulations. The pK(a) values of the individual pMBAs are in the range of 5.18-7.58, depending on the positions of the ligands, generating a nonuniform charge distribution on the cluster surface. The cluster interactions with inorganic and biological environment depend on the surface charge distribution, stressing the importance of understanding the protonation state of the cluster.","6578":"Heteroatom doped carbon materials have recently demonstrated an outstanding sodium storage ability and are being considered as the most promising candidate as anodes for sodium ion batteries. However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between structural and electronic properties and electrochemical storage capacity. First-principles calculations on a doped graphene cluster propose that N, S co-doping can promote the electronegativity, adsorption capacity of Na atoms and diffusion of Na+ ions on graphene sheets, especially for the sample consisting of more pyridinic-N, while excessive O atoms may alleviate these. All these features render N, S co-doped carbon as a superior anode for sodium ion batteries. Therefore, the N, S co-doped carbon nanosheets are fabricated via a simple thermal treatment method using gelatin as the carbon source and thiourea as the N and S precursor. The optimized product (m(gelatin) : m(thiourea) = 1 : 10) results in a superb cycling capacity of 300 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of similar to 100%. This study provides a facile and reliable route to prepare co-doped carbon with enhanced sodium storage properties.","5489":"We proposed a strategy to construct DNA-capped Fe3O4\/SiO2 magnetic mesoporous silica (MMS) nanoparticles for potential temperature controlled drug release and magnetic hyperthermia. Drug release behavior, magnetic heating capacity, in vitro cytotoxicity, and cell uptake of the MMS-based nanocarriers were evaluated. The results showed that the DOX\/MMS-NH2-dsDNA complexes could release DOX fast at 50 degrees C, but very slow at 37 degrees C. Also, MMS-based nanocarriers could efficiently generate heat upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field due to the superparamagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the MMS-NH2-dsDNA complexes could be effectively taken up by murine breast cancer 4T1 cells, and negligible cytotoxicity of the MMS-NH2-dsDNA complexes has been observed. Therefore, DNA-capped MMS nanoparticles had potential for cancer therapy with temperature controlled drug release and magnetic hyperthermia.","1197":"Applying magnetic fields to guide and retain drug-loaded magnetic particles in vivo has been proposed as a way of treating illnesses. Largely, these efforts have been targeted at tumors. One significant barrier to long range transport within tumors is the extracellular matrix (ECM). We perform single particle measurements of 18 nm diameter nanorods undergoing magnetophoresis through ECM, and analyze the motion of these nanorods in two dimensions. We observe intra-particle magnetophoresis in this viscoelastic environment and measure the fraction of time these nanorods spend effectively hindered, versus effectively translating.

This makes it possible to control their shape and elasticity by means of external magnetic fields. Magnetic gels are therefore considered for medical and technical applications such as actuation and drug delivery systems. In this paper, we focus on a special class of magnetic gels in which the magnetic nanoparticles act as the cross-linkers of the polymer network. Experimentally this is achieved by functionalizing the nanoparticles' surface such that the polymers can covalently bind to it In this way, a coupling between the orientation of the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix is created. When an external magnetic field is applied to such a system, the magnetic particles align to the field, and due to the coupling between the nanoparticles' orientation and the gel matrix, a strain is exerted on the polymers. This leads to a shrinking of the gel as a whole. In this paper, we explain how to extend a two-dimensional simulation model for such a system (Soft Matter 8 (2012) 9923 [181) to three dimensions. We will show that, while an isotropic deformation was observed in the two-dimensional case, in three dimensions the gel shrinks anisotropically. This is due to the fact that orientational fluctuations of the nanoparticles are hindered in the direction perpendicular to an external magnetic field. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.y.

The C-dots serve as the reference signal and the Au NCs as the reporter. This method employs the specific high affinity metallophilic Hg2+-Au+ interactions which can greatly quench the red fluorescence of Au NCs, while the blue fluorescence of C-dots is stable against Hg(II), leading to distinct ratiometric fluorescence changes when exposed to Hg(II). A limit of detection of 28 nM for Hg(II) in aqueous solution was estimated. Thus we applied the sensor for the detection of Hg(II) in real water samples including tap water, lake water and mineral water samples with good results. We further demonstrated that a visual chemical sensor could be manufactured by immobilizing the nanohybrid probe on a cellulose acetate circular filter paper. The paper-based sensor immediately showed a distinct fluorescence color evolution from pink to blue after exposure to a drop of the Hg(II) solution.","5400":"Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable feedstock that has the potential to replace the diminishing fossil fuels. Herein, we reported the simultaneous conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from raw biomass into gasoline alkanes (hexanes and pentanes) and monophenols and related hydrocarbons over layered LiTaMoO6 and Ru\/C in aqueous phosphoric acid medium. Specifically, gasoline alkanes were directly yielded from the carbohydrate components, based on hemicellulose and cellulose, and the total yield could be up to 82.4%. Notably, the lignin fraction could also be transformed into monophenols, related alcohols and hydrocarbons by the one-pot reaction. It suggested that the hydrocracking of monophenol fraction could be performed in this catalytic system. The total yield of volatile products was 53% based on the lignin fraction. In this paper, the influences of phosphoric acid concentration, substrate ash and the amino acids derived from the biogenic impurities were investigated and different raw biomass substrates were tested. Furthermore, the catalysts could be reused for several runs to convert raw biomass without pretreatment.","3871":"Presently, sustainable energy as well as efficient and economical energy conversion and storage technologies has become important work in light of the rising environmental issues and dependence on portable and uninterrupted power sources. Increasingly more researchers are focusing on harvesting and converting solar energy, mechanical vibration, waste heat, and wind to electricity. Electrical energy storage technologies play a significant role in the demand for green and sustainable energy. Rechargeable batteries or secondary batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries, reversibly convert between electrical and chemical energy via redox reactions, thus storing the energy as chemical potential in their electrodes. The energy density of a rechargeable battery is determined collectively by the specific capacity of electrodes and the working voltage of the cell, which is the differential potential between the cathode and the anode. Over the past decades, a significant number of studies have focused on enhancing this specific capacity; however, studies to understand and manipulate the electrochemical potential of the electrode materials are limited. In this review, the material characteristics that determine and influence the electrochemical potentials of electrodes are discussed. In particular, the cathode materials that convert electricity and chemical potential through electrochemical intercalation reactions are investigated. In addition, we summarize the selection criteria for elements or compounds and the effect of the local atomic environment on the discharge potential, including the effects of site energy, defects, crystallinity, and microstructure, using LiMn2O4, V2O5, Mo6S8, LiFePO4, and LiCoO2 as model samples for discussion.","3459":"In tissue engineering, there is limited availability of a simple, fast and solvent-free process for fabricating micro-porous thin membrane scaffolds. This paper presents the first report of a novel surface suspension melt technique to fabricate a micro-porous thin membrane scaffolds without using any organic solvent. Briefly, a layer of polycaprolactone (PCL) particles is directly spread on top of water in the form of a suspension. After that, with the use of heat, the powder layer is transformed into a melted layer, and following cooling, a thin membrane is obtained. Two different sizes of PCL powder particles (100 mu m and 500 mu m) are used. Results show that membranes made from 100 mu m powders have lower thickness, smaller pore size, smoother surface, higher value of stiffness but lower ultimate tensile load compared to membranes made from 500 mu m powder. C2C12 cell culture results indicate that the membrane supports cell growth and differentiation. Thus, this novel membrane generation method holds great promise for tissue engineering.","3892":"The constrained motion of spindle-shaped hematite nanoparticles of about 400 nm in PAAm-hydrogelS with different degrees of cross-link density is measured utilizing the line broadening observable in Mossbauer spectra at 265-293 K. A slight decrease of nanoparticle mobility is observed upon increasing cross-link density. Mossbauer spectra of the same nanoparticles in 60 wt % sucrose solution, used as reference material, display line broadening of the same magnitude as the hydrogel samples, indicating a similar degree of motion at the atomic scale and the time scale of the Mossbauer experiment. AC (alternating current) susceptibility data indicate that the magnetic relaxation of the nanoparticles in sucrose solution mainly occurs by Brownian motion, while the absence of magnetic loss within the investigated frequency range observed in measurements on hydrogel samples reveals very limited particle mobility. This apparent contradiction between results on particle dynamics in hydrogels by Mossbauer spectroscopy and AC susceptibility measurements is explained in terms of constrained particle mobility at atomic scales.","4353":"A novel magnetic amine-functionalized polyacrylic acid-nanomagnetite (Fe3O4-PAA-NH2) adsorbent prepared using a facile surface-initiated polymerization (SIP) method has delivered a great Cr(VI) removal performance compared to as-received Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The maximum amine group (-NH2) concentration grafted onto Fe3O4-PAA is determined to be 3.925 mg g(-1) based on acid-base titrimetric analysis. The optimal pH value for Cr(VI) adsorption is around 2.0 with a Fe3O4-PAA-NH2 dose of 30 mg and contact time of 10 min at room temperature. A multilayer adsorption for the Freundlich isotherm model is well-fitted and fits better than the monolayer adsorption of the Langmuir isotherm model. The kinetics of Cr(VI) removal by the Fe3O4-PAA-NH2 nanoadsorbent is found to follow pseudo-second-order behavior with a calculated room temperature rate constant of 1.23 g mg(-1) min(-1) for a solution with an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 7.0 mg L-1 and pH value of 2.5. The competition adsorption tests show that the presence of other metals in polluted water, including Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), K(I), Ca(II), Na(I), and Mg(II), favors the Cr(VI) adsorption by the fabricated Fe3O4-PAA-NH2 nanoadsorbent due to the affinity of the chemical potential and electronegativity of each metallic element. Moreover, the prepared Fe3O4-PAA-NH2 nanoadsorbent exhibits a good reusability and retains around 85% of its Cr(VI) adsorption capacity even after 5 cycles.","7371":"There has been a huge demand for low-cost, eco-friendly, flexible and wearable electronics which find applications in personal health monitoring. Flexible electronics based on plastic substrates have been extensively studied in this regard because of their versatility. However, their fabrication involves energy consuming complex procedures and processing of eco-unfriendly materials which limit their use to certain specific applications. Here we report the fabrication of a flexible all-carbon field effect transistor (FET) using a low-cost, recyclable and biodegradable cellulose paper as both the substrate and the dielectric and pencil graphite as the source, drain, channel and gate without using any expensive, toxic or non-biodegradable materials. The FET transfer characteristics show ambipolar behavior which can be utilized in analog electronics applications like rectifiers, mixers and frequency multipliers and its mobility was found to be very high compared to reduced graphene oxide based FETs. The FET was utilized as a strain sensor which shows excellent sensitivity for very low strains (of both tensile and compressive type) which is comparable to and even better than recently reported carbon nanotube and graphene based strain sensors. The sensitivity of the FET based strain sensor can be modulated by varying the gate voltage under strain. Furthermore, we investigated the performance of the sensor by integrating it with hand gloves to detect human motion. The results indicate that the sensor can be utilized in patient surveillance in healthcare and human-machine interface (HMI) applications. The successful fabrication of this paper based all-carbon transistor using only paper and pencil graphite and its application in human motion detection using strain sensing indicate that this approach can be used for developing highly scalable, low cost, low energy, flexible electronics for healthcare without using any sophisticated fabrication methods or toxic chemicals.","554":"This is a Density Functional Theory (DFT) study on the influence of an alloying mixture of Ni-Zn catalysts on carbon nanotube, CNT, growth. The study is inspired by the one pot synthesis of carbon nanofibers during the electrolysis of Li2CO3. Unlike CVD, CNT growth initiates at the liquid\/solid, rather than gas\/solid interface in the above process. The electrodes are an amalgamated Zn cathode and with a pure Ni crucible as the anode, and both zinc and nickel (or other transition metals) are required for high yield production. The use of transition metals as the catalyst for CNT, CVD growth is well known. However, in this study we show how a mixture of the Zn-Ni alloy can act as the catalyst for the effective CNT growth. Ni and Zn are taken as an example of first row transition metals with a partially empty and completely filled d orbital respectively. The study shows that the pi-d bonding between the nanotube and the metal results in strong bond formation at the interface of the nanotube growth. The study remains valid for other such metal alloys with partially and completely filled d orbitals.","465":"A hybrid anode integrating enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by glucoamylase and non-enzymatic oxidation of glucose by gold nanoparticles is presented to achieve an efficient cascade energy conversion from starch.

This enzymatic\/non-enzymatic hybrid strategy can be employed to develop other polysaccharide or oligosaccharide fuel cells in which glucose oxidation is involved.","177":"The goal to successful wound healing is essentially to immobilize and recruit appropriate numbers of host stem or progenitor cells to the wound area. In this study, we developed a chitosan nanofiber-immobilized neuropeptide substance-P (SP), which mediates stem cell mobilization and migration, onto the surfaces of nanofibers using a peptide-coupling agent, and evaluated its biological effects on stem cells. The amount of immobilized SP on chitosan nanofibers was modulated over the range of 5.89 +\/- 3.27 to 75.29 +\/- 24.31 ng when reacted with 10 to 500 ng SP. In vitro migration assays showed that SP-incorporated nanofibers induced more rapid migration of human mesenchymal stem cells on nanofibers compared to pristine samples. Finally, the conjugated SP evoked a minimal foreign body reaction and recruited a larger number of CD29- and CD44-positive stem cells into nanofibers in a mouse subcutaneous pocket model.","2751":"Photothermal therapy based on gold nanostructures has been widely investigated as a state-of-the-art noninvasive therapy approach. Because single nanoparticles cannot harvest sufficient energy, self-assemblies of small plasmonic particles into large aggregates are required for enhanced photothermal performance. Self-assembled gold nanorods in lipid bilayer-modified microcapsules are shown to localize at tumor sites, generate vapor bubbles under near-infrared light exposure, and subsequently damage tumor tissues. The polyelectrolyte multilayer enables dense packing of gold nanorods during the assembly process, which leads to the formation of vapor bubbles around the excited capsules. The resulting vapor bubbles achieve a high efficiency of suppressing tumor growth compared to single gold nanorods. In vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of soft-polymer multilayer microcapsules to cross the biological barriers of the body and localize at target tissues.","2644":"Photocatalysis has been distinguished itself as one of the most promising technologies from the wide variety of renewable energy projects underway, as it represents a promising approach to realize solar energy conversion. Under light irradiation, semiconductors (TiO2, Ag3PO4, WO3, CdS, and ZnS etc.) have demonstrated great potential in photolysis of water to yield hydrogen fuel, decomposition or oxidization of hazardous substances, photoelectrochemical conversion, as well as artificial photosynthesis. However, the disadvantages of easy agglomeration, and low solar energy conversion efficiency of these inorganic catalysts limit their large scale applications. Developing new photocatalysts has been attracting great attention in the related research communities. Owing to their structural diversity and controllable synthetic procedures, coordination polymers (CPs) provide a newly emerging platform to organize light harvesting antennae and catalytic centers to achieve solar energy conversion. Besides, controllable integration of CPs with functional materials is leading to the creation of new multifunctional composites\/hybrids, which exhibit superior photocatalytic performances to those of the individual components due to the collective behavior of the functional units. In this article, the latest advances of CPs based materials in the application of photocatalysis are critically reviewed, and the main approaches for efficient light harvesting and active site engineering in CPs-based photocatalysts are discussed. The main advantages of CPs as photocatalysts and the challenges faced for further improving catalytic performance are also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Applying gel electrophoresis and fluorescent spectroscopy methods shows that the SLNs have high binding affinity to double-stranded DNA, but despite this fact, we have not observed any significant transfection activity toward three different mammalian cell lines. A UV-spectroscopic study reveals that interaction between the SLNs and the polynucleotide leads to partial denaturation of the DNA located on the surface of the nanoparticles that can hinder transfection.","1480":"One-dimensional (1D) porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) decorated by silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a one-pot\/self-template synthesis strategy by combining electrospinning and carbonization methods. The characterization results revealed that AgNPs were homogenously distributed along the CNFs and possessed a relatively uniform nano-size of about 12 nm. The novel membrane distinctively displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation. The membrane exhibited excellent dye degradation and bacteria disinfection in batch experiments. The high photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the highly accessible surface areas, good light absorption capability, and high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The as-prepared membranes can be easily recycled because of their 1D property.","1533":"A one-pot method for the fast synthesis of a 3D nanochain network (NNC) of PdCu alloy without any surfactants is described. The composition of the as-prepared PdCu alloy catalysts can be precisely controlled by changing the precursor ratio of Pd to Cu. First, the Cu content changes the electronic structure of Pd in the 3D NNC of PdCu alloy. Second, the 3D network structure offers large open pores, high surface areas, and self-supported properties. Third, the surfactant-free strategy results in a relatively clean surface. These factors all contribute to better electrocatalytic activity and durability towards ethanol oxidation. Moreover, the use of copper in the alloy lowers the price of the catalyst by replacing the noble metal palladium with non-noble metal copper. The composition-optimized Pd80Cu20 alloy in the 3D NNC catalyst shows an increased electrochemically active surface area (80.95 m(2)g(-1)) and a 3.62-fold enhancement of mass activity (6.16 Amg(-1)) over a commercial Pd\/C catalyst.","6077":"Three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous SnO2-MxOy (M= Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) hybrid networks possess unique compositional and structural features that are beneficial to lithium storage and are thus anticipated to meet the performance requirements of advanced lithium-ion batteries for transportation and stationary energy storage. Herein, a facile, scalable, and versatile cyanogel-derived method for the construction of 3D nanoporous SnO2-MxOy hybrid networks was developed for the first time. The formation of 3D nanoporous SnO2-NiO, SnO2-alpha-Fe2O3, and SnO2-NiO-Co3O4 hybrid networks was illustrated by using Sn-M cyanogels as precursors. Moreover, the anodic performance of the 3D nanoporous SnO2-NiO hybrid network was examined to demonstrate proof of concept. After coating with polypyrrole-derived carbon, the SnO2-NiO@C hybrid network exhibited superior lithium-storage capabilities in terms of specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability.","4793":"Carbon nanofiber webs with a hierarchically porous structure and a large surface area were developed by KOH activation of the pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose (denoted as pBC), which was extracted from the low-cost, eco-friendly and industrially producible coconut juice. The activated-pBC (denoted as A-pBC-x, x represents the mass ratio of KOH to pBC, x = 5, 6 and 7) is composed of inter-welded homogeneous carbon nanofibers, which construct a mechanically robust three-dimensional (3D) conductive porous network. As an anode material for the lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the A-pBC-x exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance compared to the pBC and current commercial graphite. Remarkably, the A-pBC-6 electrode can deliver a specific capacity of over 857.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) and retain high capacity of 325.38 mAh g(-1) even cycled at high current density of 4000 mA g(-1). The significant improvement for the lithium storage performance of the A-pBC-6 sample could be attributed to its hierarchical micropore-mesopore structure and high surface area, which can greatly enhance the contact area of the electrode-electrolyte, decrease the diffusion resistance of lithium ions, shorten the diffusion length of lithium ions and provide a solid and continuous pathway for electron transport.

However, proton conductivity of chitosan is low and it is necessary to enhance its conductivity. In this work, 10 wt% sulfonated chitosan (SCS) and different amounts of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) nanosheets are incorporated into a chitosan membrane to investigate their effects on the electrochemical properties of the membrane. The proton conductivity and methanol permeability tests conducted on the CS\/SCS\/SGO membranes show that the conductivity is increased by 454%, the permeability is reduced by 23% and hence the selectivity is increased by 650%, relative to the neat chitosan, at SGO content of 5 wt%. Furthermore, combined addition of SCS and SGO to chitosan causes much more proton conductivity enhancement than the individual additives due to the synergistic effect of SCS and SGO. The observed synergistic effect reveals the importance of the chemical functionality of chitosan and nanofillers in the formation of ionic cluster domains with enhanced size within the membranes for proton transport. Finally, a Nernst-Planck based model is applied to the experimental proton conductivity data in order to shed more light on the role of GOs in the proton conductivity mechanism of chitosan.

And degumming is a critical procedure that has been developed to hold the ramie fiber's shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky luster to the fabric appearance. Herein, we introduce a fundamentally new working principle into the field of ramie fiber degumming by using the triboelectric effect. Resort to a water-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (WD-TENG), the ramie fibers degumming efficiency was greatly enhanced with improved fiber quality, including both surface morphology and mechanical properties. Furthermore, it saves the chemicals usage in the traditional method, which makes it a green and practical approach to fully remove the noncellulosic compositions from ramie fibers. In addition, as a systematical study, the WD-TENG was further employed as a sustainable power source to electrochemically degrade the degumming wastewater by recycling the kinetic energy from flowing wastewater in a self-powered manner. Under a fixed current output of 3.5 mA and voltage output of 10 V, the self-powered cleaning system was capable of cleaning up to 90% of the pollutants in the wastewater in 120 min. Given the compelling features of being self-powered, environmentally friendly, extremely cost-effective, good stability, high degumming and degradation efficiency, the presented work renders an innovative approach for natural fiber extraction, and could be widely adopted as a green and innovative technology in textile industry.

Because reduced graphene oxide (rGO), originating from inexpensive graphite, serves as a higher-performance energy-storage electrode than conventional activated carbons and carbon nanotubes, research and development of rGO\/polymer composite electrodes for flexible supercapacitors have become a center of attraction. However, the fabrication of rGO-based flexible electrodes frequently requires a long time with high-temperature treatment or toxic chemical treatment, resulting in the lack of scalability and eco-friendliness. Here we show a fast, scalable, and environment-compatible route to fabricate a high-performance rGO\/cellulose paper supercapacitor electrode. Single-layer graphene oxide (GO) sheets and recycled waste pulp fibers were successfully fabricated into a paper composite by a well-established scalable papermaking process, followed by a room-temperature, additive-free, and millisecond-timescale flash reduction process. The as-prepared rGO\/paper electrode had a high specific capacitance, up to 212 F g(-1), for an all paper-based flexible supercapacitor, comparable to those of state-of-the-art rGO-based electrodes, while dramatically decreasing the reduction time of GO from the conventional hour timescale to milliseconds. This work will pave the way for green, flexible, and mass-producible energy-storage paper in future wearable electronics.","1328":"An electrochemical sensor based on graphitized carbon nanofibers modified on glassy carbon electrode (GCE\/CNF) has been developed for simultaneous determination of guanine and adenine in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In cyclic voltammetry (CV), GCE\/CNF shows two well-defined and well-separated irreversible oxidation peaks at 0.74 and 0.98 V vs Ag\/AgCl for electrochemical oxidations of guanine and adenine, respectively when compared to unmodified GCE. Whereas, unmodified GCE shows feeble peak response for guanine and adenine in physiological medium. Differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) technique was further used for the quantification assays. As like CV, DPV also showed well-defined and well-separated current signals for guanine and adenine at 0.66 and 0.92 V vs Ag\/AgCl, respectively. Note that CNF is about ten times lesser cost than multi-walled carbon nanotubes. DPV technique was further adopted for simultaneous determination of guanine and adenine. DPV parameters are systematically optimized in pH 7 PBS in the presence of mixture of analytes using the modified electrode. GCE\/CNF shows good stability with linear range of 15-105 mu M and 15-120 mu M for guanine and adenine detections, respectively. Obtained sensitivity and detection limits (S\/N=3) are comparable and superior than previously reported carbon based modified electrodes.","7043":"In several important classes of inverting carbohydrate-active enzymes, the identity of the catalytic base remains elusive, including in family 6 Glycoside Hydrolase (GH6) enzymes, which are key components of cellulase cocktails for cellulose depolymerization. Despite many structural and kinetic studies with both wild-type and mutant enzymes, especially on the Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) GH6 cellulase (TrCel6A), the catalytic base in the single displacement inverting mechanism has not been definitively identified in the GH6 family. Here, we employ transition path sampling to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, which provides unbiased atomic-level understanding of key order parameters involved in cleaving the strong glycosidic bond. Our hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM\/MM) simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonding that aligns two active site water molecules that play key roles in hydrolysis: one water molecule drives the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the substrate and a second shuttles a proton to the putative base (D175) via a short water wire. We also investigated the case where the putative base is mutated to an alanine, an enzyme that is experimentally still partially active. The simulations predict that proton hopping along a water wire via a Grotthuss mechanism provides a mechanism of catalytic rescue. Further simulations reveal that substrate processive motion is 'driven' by strong electrostatic interactions with the protein at the product sites and that the -1 sugar adopts a S-2(O) ring configuration as it reaches its binding site. This work thus elucidates previously elusive steps in the processive catalytic mechanism of this important class of enzymes.","2628":"Extracts from the lyophilized Aloe vera leaves powder demonstrated antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The qualitative analysis of lyophilized Aloe vera leaves, indicated the presence of the ion content (Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, Fe2+, Zn2+ etc.) and quantitative analysis (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry) indicated presence of K, Ca, Cr, also Sc and Sb metals. The pH analysis of extracts (aqueous and hydroalcoholic 1:1) were performed at different periods of time (after 5, 10 and 30 days) and it showed a good stability in time. The spectrometric analysis of the fresh extracts after 30 days indicated a slight decrease of absorbance and slows in time compounds degradation. Compounds as reducing agents, monosaccharides and polyholosides, anthraquinones, flavonoids, saponins and tannins were identified in both extracts. The antioxidant properties were demonstrated by permanganometry and cyclic voltammetry technique. The aqueous extract of Aloe vera leaves shown 37.52 % of such bioactive compounds, while in the hydroalcoholic one; the percentage was bigger than 62.41 %.

The redox flow battery is considered suitable for large-scale applications due to its modular design, good scalability and flexible operation. The biggest challenge of the redox flow battery is the low energy density. The redox active species is the most important component in redox flow batteries, and the redox potential and solubility of redox species dictate the system energy density. This review is focused on the recent development of redox species. Different categories of redox species, including simple inorganic ions, metal complexes, metal-free organic compounds, polysulfide\/sulfur and lithium storage active materials, are reviewed. The future development of redox species towards higher energy density is also suggested.","5948":"A facile and efficient method was developed to prepare nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogels (NGHs) via a one-pot hydrothermal route with graphene oxide (GO) and urea. In the procedure, urea was used as a reducing-doping agent to continuously release NH3, and N element of which was doped into graphene lattice by three styles (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic\/quaternary N). The NGHs have high nitrogen content (ca. 6.04-6.84%), lightweight nature (the density of hydrogel is ca. 0.81-0.94 g cm(-3)), and numerous interconnected three dimensional porous networks. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrated the good capacitive behavior (230.6 F g(-1), at 0.5 A g(-1)) and superior cycling stability (capacitance retention similar to 90% after 1200 cycles) of NGHs.

In our previous report, MGT showed genotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo assay systems, and it was suggested that inflammatory responses exist behind the genotoxicity. To further clarify mechanisms underlying the genotoxicity, a comprehensive DNA adduct (DNA adductome) analysis was conducted using DNA samples derived from the lungs of mice exposed to MGT. In total, 30 and 42 types of DNA adducts were detected in the vehicle control and MGT-treated groups, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) against a subset of DNA adducts was applied and several adducts, which are deduced to be formed by inflammation or oxidative stress, as the case of etheno-deoxycytidine (epsilon dC), revealed higher contributions to MGT exposure. By quantitative-LC-MS\/MS analysis, epsilon dC levels were significantly higher in MGT-treated mice than those of the vehicle control. Taken together with our previous data, it is suggested that inflammatory responses might be involved in the genotoxicity induced by MGT in the lungs of mice.","4722":"Graphene-winged carbon nanotubes (G-CNTs) have been prepared by the well-controlled outer-wall peeling of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The final hybrid structure features the few layers of graphene nanosheets attaching to the intact inner walls of CNTs. On one hand, the outer branched graphene nanosheets could suppress the aggregation of CNTs and introduce abundant defects and active-edges for easily accessible chemical interaction. On the other hand, the CNTs could bridge the graphene nanosheets for rapid electron transfer and mechanical robustness. As a result, the G-CNTs was used as the electrode materials exhibiting an extremely steady reversible capacity of 603 mAh g(-1) over 2200 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1) (the corresponding area capacity is 0.16 mAh cm(-2) at a current density of 0.26 mA cm(-2)) and owning a high rate capability much superior to those of the pristine MWCNT-based counterparts.

Following this, electrospinning was carried out. Next, the morphologies of the electrospun fibres and properties of the electrospinning solution were investigated. The results showed that fibres derived from liquefied wood via an electrospinning process could be obtained satisfactorily by synthesizing the electrospinning solution. The morphologies of the electrospun fibres with diameters of around 2.0 mu m were favourable as liquefied wood, and 6%PVP\/ethanol solution was mixed at a ratio of 1: 1 by weight. With the increasing concentration of liquefied wood, the surface tension of the electrospinning solution increased from 0.022 N\/m to 0.033 N\/m. Additionally, the conductivity increased on a small scale. Furthermore, when the liquefied wood was added to the PVP\/ethanol solution, more micro-molecules were introduced into the mixture, thus the viscosity decreased significantly due to the attenuation of PVP.","3123":"Manipulating surface properties using chemistry and roughness has led to the development of advanced multifunctional surfaces. Here, in a nanostructured polymer film consisting of a hydrophilic reservoir of chitosan\/carboxymethyl cellulose capped with various hydrophobic layers, we demonstrate the role of a third design factor, water permeation rate. We use this additional design criterion to produce antifogging coatings that readily absorb water vapor while simultaneously exhibiting hydrophobic character to liquid water. These zwitter-wettable films, produced via aqueous layer-by-layer assembly, consist of a nanoscale thin hydrophobic capping layer (chitosan\/Nafion) that enables water vapor to diffuse rapidly into the underlying hydrophilic reservoir rather than nucleating drops of liquid water on the surface. We characterize these novel films using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and via depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in addition to extensive testing for fogging\/antifogging performance.","1786":"Fundamental science must be nurtured for technological success to prevail, emphasizes Serdar Sariciftci, head of the Linz Institute for Organic Solar Cells at Johannes Kepler University in Austria.

SEM and TEM results reveal that the diameters of the as-prepared fibers are 100 +\/- 30 nm. The light adsorption of Bi4Ti3O12 and Bi2Ti2O7 in the fibers has been remarkably improved by Cr doping. With increased Cr doping, XRD and XPS show that the amount of Bi2Ti2O7 increases in the fibers. As a result, the Bi4Ti3O12\/Bi2Ti2O7 heterojunction structure is enhanced, which further promotes the charge separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Photocatalytic tests indicated that the as-prepared Cr-doped Bi4Ti3O12\/Bi2Ti2O7 fibers exhibit good photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light irradiation.","5372":"Electrospun fiber has highly structural similarity with natural bone extracelluar mairix ECM). Many researches about fabricating organic inorganic composite materials have been carried out in order to mimic the natural composition of bone and enhance the biocompatibility of materials. In this work, pearl powder was added to the poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and the composite nanoriber scaffold was prepared by electrospinning. Mineralization ability of the composite scaffolds can be evaluated by analyzing hydroxyapatite (HA) formation on the surface of nanoliber scaffolds. The obtained composite nanoliber scaffolds showed an enhanced mineralization capacity due to incorporation of pearl powder. The HA fonued amount of the composite scaffolds was raised as the increase of pearl powder in composite scaffolds. Therefore, the prepared PHBV\/pearl composite nanofiber scaffolds would be a promising candidate as an osteoconductive composite material for bone repairing.

Coli, S. Aureus, and Pseudomonas] from contaminated water. The unique concept involves formation of core shell particles with a functional core of zeolite and a porous shell of ZnO nanoflakes which not only imparts photocatalytic and antibacterial properties but also renders the surface negatively charged, thereby facilitating rapid adsorption of Pb(II) and MB. The uniform formation of ZnO nanoflakes (shell) on the zeolite (core) surface has been confirmed by XRD, DRS, FE-SEM, and TEM studies. Metal ion adsorption studies under varying conditions of time and concentration indicate that the material follows the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second order kinetics with good correlation to the experimental data. The rapid and high adsorption capacity of the material for both Pb (II) and MB has been established while factors responsible for enhanced adsorption have been discussed. The antibacterial studies against Gram negative bacteria (E. Coli and Pseudomonas) and Gram positive bacteria (S. Aureus) showed good zone inhibition characteristics. The material can be regenerated and reused besides having ease of separation using simple techniques. Being multifunctional, efficient, nontoxic, energy neutral, and recyclable with no effluent generation, the material is an efficient and sustainable alternative for water purification.","7307":"A great variety of biologically relevant monolayers present phase coexistence characterized by domains formed by lipids in an ordered phase state dispersed in a continuous, disordered phase. From the difference in surface densities between these phases, inter-domain dipolar interactions arise. These interactions are relevant for the determination of the spacial distribution of domains as well as their dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel way of estimating the dipolar repulsion using a passive method that involves the analysis of images of the monolayer with phase coexistence. This method is based on the comparison of the pair correlation function obtained from experiments with that obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of a model system. As an example, we determined the difference in dipolar density of a binary monolayer of DSPC\/DMPC at the air-water interface from the analysis of the radial distribution of domains, and the results are compared with those obtained by surface potential determinations. A systematic analysis for the experimentally relevant parameter range is given, which may be used as a working curve for obtaining the dipolar repulsion in different systems.","4292":"Fluorescent polymer nanofibers have wide applications in the fields of nano-photonics, nanooptoelectronics, chemical sensors and light-emitting diodes. The doping of small fluorophores into low-cost polymers is a proven alternative route to produce cost-effective and high-performance optical materials. In order to gain deep insight into the photophysical processes of small molecule-doped polymer nanofiber systems and obtain highly sensitive and cost-effective explosive fluorescent sensors, a new type of highly sensitive low-cost sensor for nitro-compounds was synthesized based on PEO\/MePyCz (polyethylene oxide\/4-(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) ethoxy)-9-(pyren-1-yl)-9H-carbazole) composite nanofibers. It exhibited fast response and high quenching efficiency towards DNT vapor, which may be attributed to an improved exciton migration of MePyCz in PEO in addition to the large driving force of the electron transfer and the nanofibrous structures. Additionally, it promoted a fluorescence resonance energy transfer process in the polymer fibrous matrix with a green-emitting material of 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one. The sensing composite nanofibrous film had good sensitivity and selectivity and might be constructed into a portable detector for explosives.","2249":"The present paper reports novel outcome comprising experimental results on electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and radar signal absorption characteristics of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2\/SiO2 core-shell nanofibers. 1D TiO2\/SiO2 core-shell nanofibers with various concentrations of nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated using a single-nozzle co-electrospinning method. The core-shell structure of polyvinylpyrrolidone\/polyacrylonitrile nanofibers with NPs have been electrospun from the homogeneous solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP and TiO2 NPs, as core) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN and SiO2 NPs, as shell). The morphologies and structures of TiO2\/SiO2 core-shell nanofibers were characterized by XRD, FTIR, EDS, and SEM images. Microwave absorption properties of the synthesized nanofibers were studied using a vector network analyzer between 2 and 20 GHz at room temperature. The maximum EMI-shielding effectiveness of 150 dB is obtained with the dominant shielding mechanism of absorption of EM radiation. The excellent microwave absorption properties of the composites nanofibers are attributed to the special 1D fibrous structure and the effective dielectric loss.","970":"Chloromethylfurfural (CMF), a valuable intermediate for the production of chemicals and fuels, can be derived in high yields from the cellulose component of biomass. This study examined the effect of sugarcane bagasse components and biomass architecture on CMF\/bio-oil yield using a HCl\/dichloroethane biphasic system. The type of pretreatment affected bio-oil yield, as the CMF yield increased with increasing glucan content. CMF yield reached 81.9% with bagasse pretreated by acidified aqueous ionic liquid, which had a glucan content of 81.6%. The lignin content of the biomass was found to significantly reduce CMF yield, which was only 62.3% with an acid-catalysed steam exploded sample having a lignin content of 29.6%. The change of CMF yield may be associated with fibre surface changes as a result of pretreatment. The hemicellulose content also impacted negatively on CMF yield. Storage of the bio-oil in chlorinated solvents prevented CMF degradation.","4638":"In this paper, a kind of magnetic mesoporous iron oxide\/silica composite aerogels with high adsorption ability is prepared by ambient pressure drying method.

The adsorption test indicates that the obtained magnetic aerogels showed prominent adsorption capability with the adsorption rate for Rhodamine B in aqueous solution could attain to 95.8 % within 80 min. Moreover, all the composite aerogels exhibited good magnetic properties and could be easily separated from the water after adsorption.","4054":"A bifunctional ternary heterostructured In2S3\/MoS2\/CdS composite photocatalyst with high activity and stability under visible light irradiation was fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method. The bifunctional ternary heterostructured photocatalyst displayed higher activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution than GO\/CdS and rGO\/CdS composites and can be compared with the hydrogen-gennerating efficiency of systems containing the well-known Pt co-catalyst. But above all, the photocorrosion of CdS was also suppressed effectively. The heterojunction structure between MoS2 and CdS promoted the interfacial charge transfer process, suppressed the charge recombination and enhanced the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Due to the well matching of the VB of CdS with that of In2S3, holes on the VB of CdS could be easily transferred to that of In2S3 via the heterojunction structure between In2S3 and CdS, which prevented the accumulation of holes on the VB of CdS, inhibited its photocorrosion and dramatically enhanced its stability. The structure sequence and deposition site play an important role in photocatalytic activity: MoS2 deposited on the interface of CdS and In2S3 was more efficient in promoting charge transfer and thus significantly improved the photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalyst. Our findings pave a way to design bifunctional CdS-based ternary heterostructured composites for highly efficient H-2 generation and photocorrosion suppression.","3102":"TiO2 is one of the most exciting anode candidates for safe application in lithium ion batteries. However, its low intrinsic electronic conductivity limits application. In this paper, a simple sal gel based route is presented to produce nanosize TiO2 fibers with 119 +\/- 27 nm diameters via electrospinning. Subsequent calcination in various atmospheres was applied to achieve anatase and anatase-rutile mixed phase crystallites with and without carbon coating. The crystallite size was 5 nm for argon calcined fibers and 13-20 nm for air calcined fibers. Argon calcined TiO2 nanofibers exhibited electronic conductivity orders of magnitude higher than those of air-calcined samples. Lithium diffusivity was increased by one time and specific capacity by 26.9% due to the enhanced conductivity. It also had a different intercalation mechanism of lithium. Hydrogen post heat-treatment was found to benefit electronic conductivity (by 3-4.5 times), lithium diffusivity (1.5-2 times) and consequently the high rate performance of the TiO2 nanofibers (over 80%). The inner mechanism and structure-property relations among these parameters were also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, nanofibrous scaffolds were produced by emulsion electrospinning of either metformin hydrochloride (MH) or metoprolol tartrate (MPT) with poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV). The influence of preparation processes and emulsion compositions (polymer\/drug\/surfactant Span 80) towards the drug release behaviour of the scaffolds, together with their morphology, surface and thermal properties were evaluated. In vitro release studies indicated that the emulsion electrospun nanofibers significantly alleviated the burst release and produced a sustained release of drugs compared to the blended electrospun nanofibers. Between the two polymers studied, PCL demonstrated a better drug delivery carrier compared to PHBV, and MPT incorporated nanofibers showed less burst release than the others. The emulsion electrospun nanofibers were evaluated for their cytotoxicity using human mesenchymal stem cells and the cytotoxicity results showed that the emulsion electrospun MPT\/PCL scaffold favoured cell growth compared to other tested scaffolds. Our study shows that emulsion electrospinning could be a better technique than normal blend electrospinning, especially in modulating the drug release properties by regulating the oil phase and water phase of the emulsions to obtain the desired drug release for the drug delivery systems. And PCL may be a better drug delivery carrier than PHBV.","4830":"The feasibility of preparing activated carbon (AC-CHs) from carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose and starch) with phosphoric acid activation was evaluated by comparing its physicochemical properties and Ni(II) adsorption performance with a reference activated carbon (AC-PA) derived from Phragmites australis. The textural and chemical properties of the prepared activated carbon were characterized by N-2 adsorption\/desorption isotherms, SEM, Boehm's titration and XPS. Although AC-CHs had much lower surface area (less than 700 m(2) g(-1)) than AC-PA (1057 m(2) g(-1)), they exhibited 45-70% larger Ni(II) adsorption capacity which could be mainly attributed to their 50-75% higher contents of total acidic and basic groups. The comparison of XPS analyses for starch-based activated carbon before and after Ni(II) adsorption indicated that Ni(II) cation combined with the oxygen-containing groups and basic groups (delocalized pi-electrons) through the mechanisms of proton exchange, electrostatic attraction, and surface complexation. Kinetic results suggested that chemical reaction was the main rate-controlling step, and a very quick Ni(II) adsorption performance of AC-CHs was presented with similar to 95% of maximum adsorption within 30 min. Both adsorption capacity and rate of the activated carbon depended on the surface chemistry as revealed by batch adsorption experiments and XPS analyses. This study demonstrated that AC-CHs could be promising materials for Ni(II) pollution minimization.","4697":"The past decade has witnessed significantly increased interest in the development of smart polypeptide-based organo- and hydrogel systems with stimuli responsiveness, especially those that exhibit sol-gel phase-transition properties, with an anticipation of their utility in the construction of adaptive materials, sensor designs, and controlled release systems, among other applications. Such developments have been facilitated by dramatic progress in controlled polymerizations of -amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), together with advanced orthogonal functionalization techniques, which have enabled economical and practical syntheses of well-defined polypeptides and peptide hybrid polymeric materials. One-dimensional stacking of polypeptides or peptide aggregations in the forms of certain ordered conformations, such as helices and sheets, in combination with further physical or chemical cross-linking, result in the construction of three-dimensional matrices of polypeptide gel systems. The macroscopic sol-gel transitions, resulting from the construction or deconstruction of gel networks and the conformational changes between secondary structures, can be triggered by external stimuli, including environmental factors, electromagnetic fields, and (bio)chemical species. Herein, the most recent advances in polypeptide gel systems are described, covering synthetic strategies, gelation mechanisms, and stimuli-triggered sol-gel transitions, with the aim of demonstrating the relationships between chemical compositions, supramolecular structures, and responsive properties of polypeptide-based organo- and hydrogels.","1075":"Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as a promising commercial alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for next-generation battery systems. However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by several obstacles, such as the insulating nature of elemental sulfur and the high solubility of lithium polysulfide products. In this work, a new type of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) microsphere was synthesized successfully and used as a carbon framework for the sulfur cathode of lithium sulfur batteries. Commercial aqueous-dispersed MWCNTs of low cost are easily accessible for the large-scale production of the carbon skeleton through a simple spray drying approach. The as-prepared carbon framework shows a porous microspherical architecture with the particle size of around several micrometers, and the MWCNTs in it are intertwined to construct a three-dimensional (3D) continuous electronic conductive network. For the sulfur cathode, the C\/S microspheres (MS-C\/S) were facilely prepared by a melt-diffusion method. The obtained MS-C\/S electrode displays excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The electrode with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) shows an initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1) and a stable capacity of 858 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.2C. Even when the current rate increases to 0.5C, a stable capacity of 806 mA h g(-1) is maintained over 100 cycles.","7280":"Magnetic responsive photonic crystals (MRPCs) stand for a new trend in the field of photonic crystals. Compared with normal responsive photonic crystals built by sensitive hydrogels, their intriguing properties, such as instant responsive behavior and more uniform diffractive color, are most attractive. The synthesis of magnetic nanocrystals for MRPCs requires a highly reliable and facile method to guarantee the monodispersibility and stability. Popularly used methods, especially those claimed as one-pot methods, were conducted in Teflon-lined autoclaves. However, several shortcomings, like expense of large scale equipment, safety issues with generating high pressures in reactions, and latent pollution issues of Teflon liners, have restricted the large scale application of autoclaves. Thus an alternative facile one-pot method for MRPCs has been developed in our work. It is simply conducted in glass containers with milder conditions such as ambient pressure, air atmosphere, and relatively low reaction temperature. Moreover, by fixing a relatively high stoichiometric ratio of alkali, the size of each unit can be readily controlled by the additional amount of water, as it is called the \"rich-alkali-poor-water\" (RAPW) method. The as synthesized nanocrystals are found to be useful in mapping unknown or irregular magnetic fields as one of their potential applications.","41":"There are still many problems in the conductive adhesive, such as particle size and particle dispersion in the matrix, which can affect the stability of the electrical conductivity. In order to resolve the particle dispersion issue in the anisotropic conductive films (ACFs) during the bonding process, we need to increase capture rate of conductive balls between the top and the bottom metal electrodes. In this paper, the methods of increasing capture rates were studied. The capture rates of the conventional 20-and 10-mu m polymer ball ACFs were compared. In addition, the capture rates of the conventional polymer ball ACF and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber incorporated a polymer ball ACF were compared. As a result, the capture rates of 20-mu m polymer ball ACFs were similar to 30% higher than 10-mu m polymer ball ACFs. And the capture rate of PVDF nanofiber incorporated polymer ball ACF was 21% higher than the conventional polymer ball ACF. By using nanofiber and larger size of conductive balls, the capture rates can be increased.","1074":"Poor electrochemical performances of materials in commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) make it difficult to realize battery technologies for future electric power applications such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles. To reach beyond the horizon of state-of-the-art LIBs, the exploration of next generation batteries composed of rationally designed nanomaterials in consideration of the structure, phase and element influencing the battery performance is critical. By virtue of the simple set-up, versatility, size controllability and mass-productivity of electrospinning, one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers (NFs) produced via electrospinning are attractive candidates for the construction of advanced secondary batteries. A comprehensive review of the forefront in the development of electrospun NFs as advanced materials of next generation LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), lithium-sulfur batteries and lithium-air batteries with particular emphasis on synthesis and improved energy and power density, and cyclability is presented. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements in electrospun 1D nano-architectures with large surface area to volume ratios and controllable morphologies as anodes, cathodes, separators, electrolytes and even catalytic materials. Furthermore, current challenges and prospects of electrospun NFs in both academia and industry are also discussed. We expect that this review opens up new research activities in a variety of research fields including advanced rechargeable batteries.","879":"Graphene aerogels are desirable for energy storage and conversion, as catalysis supports, and as adsorbents for environmental remediation. To produce graphene aerogels with low density, while maintaining high electrical conductivity and strong mechanic performance, we synthesized graphene aerogels by the magnesiothermic reduction of a freeze-dried graphene oxide (GO) self-assembly and subsequent etching of the formed MgO in acid solution. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel samples exhibited densities as low as 1.1 mg center dot cm(-3). The rGO aerogel was very resilient, exhibiting full recoveryeven after being compressed by strains of up to 80%; its elastic modulus (E) scaled with density (rho) as E similar to rho(2). The rGO aerogels also exhibited high conductivities (e.g., 27.7 S center dot m(-1) at 3.6 mg center dot cm(-3)) and outperformed many rGO aerogels fabricated by other reduction processes. Such outstanding properties were ascribed to the microstructures inherited from the freeze-dried GO self-assembly and the magnesiothermic reduction process.","1768":"In the present study, a series of cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (CSPB), consisting of a silica core and a shell of copolymer of acrylamide (AM) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (METAC), were synthesized. Then a dual-component system which was composed of CSPB and anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) was used to improve the retention and drainage properties of bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Comparative researches about retention and drainage properties between CSPB\/APAM system and cationic starch\/APAM system were undertaken as well. Results showed that further improvement in first-pass retention (FPR) of pulp, FPR of PCC and drainage time could be achieved by CSPB\/APAM system. It was also found that increase of shear intensity led to a decrease in retention efficiency, while it had no significant influence on drainage time of pulp. However, due to the symmetrical or quasi-symmetrical spherical brush structure, CSPB still showed better retention efficiency than cationic starch under different turbulent conditions. Furthermore, the flocculation mechanism of the CSPB\/APAM dual-component system was proposed in the paper. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

A solvent post-treatment by soaking the B-CA ENMs in a mixture solution with different ethanol\/acetone volume ratios was also performed to improve the mechanical properties of the membranes. In this study, we showed that this approach can enhance the bonding in the fiber membranes by solvent-induced fusion of inter-fiber junction points and change the degree of molecular orientation of the polymer, which are both considered to have important influences on the mechanical properties of ENMs. The treated membranes exhibited a significant enhancement in mechanical strength while retaining high hydraulic permeability. Increased performances will improve the prospects of ENMs as an emerging material in the filtration space for handling and scale-up manufacturing.","1765":"The new phase of YbAg2 was obtained using high-pressure and high-temperature reaction.

The 3-D porous microspheres consist of Si\/SiO2 nanoparticles (around 5-10 nm) covered by a layer of carbon and connected by graphene. We explored the electrochemical properties of the porous microspheres as an anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In SiO2\/Si\/graphene\/C microspheres, numerous pores could leave enough room for volume expansion and contraction of silicon during lithiation and delithiation, and provide large space voids for electrolyte reserves. Meanwhile, graphene plays a role in reinforcing the porous structure. The prepared sample shows superior cyclability with a discharge capacity of 1104.9 mA h g(-1) in the second cycle and 1141.6 mA h g(-1) over 200 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2).

Shearing followed by drying leads to the dealignment before the water can be removed; continuous shear whilst drying is required to maintain the alignment. Combining a slow pH change with continuous shear allows alignment of the gelling fibres, which can then be dried.","3698":"This study investigated how the particle size of the modified adsorbent diatomite earth & chitosan (DE&C) affects the removal of sunset yellow (SY) from water using a fixed bed column. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that the amino group (-NH2) played an important role during the adsorption of SY. The calculated surface area of the DE&C absorbent was found to be 69.68 m(2) g(-1) and SEM images showed that DE&C is a superior porous adsorbent. Four dimensions of DE&C were measured in a fixed bed column. The breakthrough time of SY increased as the size of DE&C decreased and the effluent concentration showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. It was also found that the nature of the variation in the effluent concentration with time was parabolic and that the adsorption data fitted the parabolic equation at C-t\/C-0 = 0-0.1. Due to the different combination ability with hydrogen bonding, the phenomenon of parabolic variation is quite disparate from other adsorbents. But, compared with the breakthrough time, the saturation time was close to other particle sizes, except for 2.86-3.35 mm in size. pH is an important parameter for the adsorption of SY and the main mechanism is adsorption with each other between positive and negative charges. The Thomas model shows lower correlation with the smaller sizes and R-2 with an average of 0.9413. The Thomas model indicated that the maximum value of q(0) was 97.06 mg g(-1) and with an increase in the initial SY concentration, the bed height and the values of q(0) decreased as k(t) increased. The Yoon-Nelson model describing the theoretical required time was close to the experimental values and k(YN) increased as C-0 increased.","393":"Hierarchical porous carbons, which contain micropores combined with mesopores and\/or macropores, promote mass transport through the macropores\/mesopores and increase the accessibility of smaller pores compared with single-sized porous carbons. However, current synthesis procedures cannot fabricate tailored hierarchical carbons with both the freestanding structure and mesoporosity. In this work, electrospun porous hierarchical carbon nanofibers with a macro-two-dimensional monolithic structure were successfully prepared through electrospinning combined with the poly(vinylpyrrolidone) template method. The performance of these nanofibers as electrode materials for supercapacitors and vertical flow-through capacitive deionization for desalination were studied to determine the structural characteristics of the macro-two-dimensional monolithic material. This work provides a general approach for preparing carbons with controlled hierarchical pore structures and new insights into the advanced utilization of carbon materials.","5828":"Direct determination of total lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was accomplished using newly developed spiroguanidines derived from rhodamine B as universal fluorogenic probes. Optimum conditions for the quantitative analysis of total LPA were investigated.

Spider silk has been extensively studied for its biocompatibility, biodegradability and extraordinary material properties. As a protein-based biomaterial, recombinant DNA derived derivatives of spider silks have been modified with biomineralization domains which lead to silica deposition and potentially accelerated bone regeneration. However, the influence of the location of the R5 (SSKKSGSYSGSKGSKRRIL) silicifying domain fused with the spider silk protein sequence on the biosilicification process remains to be determined. Here we designed two silk-R5 fusion proteins that differed in the location of the R5 peptide, C- vs. N-terminus, where the spider silk domain consisted of a 15mer repeat of a 33 amino acid consensus sequence of the major ampullate dragline spidroin 1 from Nephila clavipes (SGRGGLGGQG AGAAAAAGGA GQGGYGGLGSQGT). The chemical, physical and silica deposition properties of these recombinant proteins were assessed and compared to a silk 15mer control without the R5 present. The location of the R5 peptide did not have a significant effect on wettability and surface energies, while the C-terminal location of the R5 promoted more controlled silica precipitation, suggesting differences in protein folding and possibly different access to charged amino acids that drive the silicification process. Further, cell compatibility in vitro, as well as the ability to promote human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation were demonstrated for both variants of the fusion proteins.","6649":"Ceria-based materials have attracted much attention as electrolyte materials for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this study, we examined the effect of synthesis method on the microstructure and the ionic conductivity of ceria-based electrolytes. Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolytes for SOFCs were prepared using the Pechini and cellulose templating (CT) methods. Microstructures of the calcined and sintered samples were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. The XRD results indicate that a single-phase fluorite structure formed at the relatively low calcination temperature of 500 A degrees C. The relative densities of the sintered pellets were higher than 90%, which was proved by the SEM images. Calcined powders were characterized by FTIR technique. The electrical properties of the samarium-doped ceria electrolytes were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The total ionic conductivities are 3.02 x 10(-2) and 3.42 x 10(-2) S\/cm at 750 A degrees C for the SDC electrolytes prepared by the Pechini method and the CT method, respectively.","2215":"Novel silica rich core-sheath ceramic microfibers where yttria stabilized zirconia core referring as ZY@S have been developed by co-axial electrospinning for dental composites reinforcement.

The 2.5% or 5% ZY@S microfibers reinforced dental composites have improved flexural strength and modulus than control without microfibers. The composites reinforced by ZY@S microfibers retain translucency and esthetics.

In the presence of a photosensitizer (salicylic acid), the organogel can serve as an excellent molecular-donor scaffold to investigate FRET to Tb3+. More importantly, heat treatment or water induction instigated a morphology transition from nanofibers to nanobelts, after which the participation of guest molecules in the FF assembly was promoted and the stability and photoluminescence emission of the composite organogels were enhanced.","87":"The ever-increasing demand for natural products and biotechnology derived from bees and ultra-modernization of various analytical devices has facilitated the rational and planned development of biotechnology products with a focus on human health to treat chronic and neglected diseases. The aim of the present study was to prepare and characterize polymeric nanoparticles loaded with Brazilian red propolis extract and evaluate the cytotoxic activity of \"multiple-constituent extract in co-delivery system\" for antileishmanial therapies. The polymeric nanoparticles loaded with red propolis extract were prepared with a combination of poly-e-caprolactone and pluronic using nanoprecipitation method and characterized by different analytical techniques, antioxidant and leishmanicidal assay. The red propolis nanoparticles in aqueous medium presented particle size (200-280 nm) in nanometric scale and zeta analysis (-20 to -26 mV) revealed stability of the nanoparticles without aggregation phenomenon during 1 month. After freeze-drying method using cryoprotectant (sodium starch glycolate), it was possible to observe particles with smooth and spherical shape and apparent size of 200 to 400 nm. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and thermal analysis revealed the encapsulation of the flavonoids from the red propolis extract into the polymeric matrix. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (UPLC-DAD) identified the flavonoids liquiritigenin, pinobanksin, isoliquiritigenin, formononetin and biochanin A in ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) and nanoparticles of red propolis extract (NRPE). The efficiency of encapsulation was determinate, and median values (75.0 %) were calculated using UPLC-DAD. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl method showed antioxidant activity to EEP and red propolis nanoparticles. Compared to negative control, EEP and NRPE exhibited leishmanicidal activity with an IC50 value of congruent to 38.0 mu g\/mL and 31.3 mu g\/mL, 47.2 mu g\/mL, 154.2 mu g\/mL and 193.2 mu g\/mL for NRPE A1, NRPE A2, NRPE A3 and NRPE A4, respectively. Nanoparticles loaded with red propolis extract in co-delivery system and EEP presented cytotoxic activity on Leishmania (V.) braziliensis. Red propolis extract loaded in nanoparticles has shown to be potential candidates as intermediate products for preparation of various pharmaceutical dosage forms containing red propolis extract in the therapy against negligible diseases such as leishmaniasis.","5705":"The problems of the large volume change during Li insertion and extraction and poor high-power performance of SnO2-based electrodes should be solved for their practical application. Herein, a novel SnO2\/C hybrid triple-type nanosphere, in which a layer of amorphous carbon was sandwiched between the layers of the SnO2 and carbon composite, has been designed and fabricated by a top-down approach. Due to its special structure, this kind of SnO2-based electrode exhibited a considerable capacitive performance, offering a greatly enhanced cycling stability and rate capability. Its capacity remained as high as 653 mA h g(-1) after the 350th cycle. The irreversible capacity decay was unprecedentedly extended to the 80th cycle. What is more, this electrode even exhibited a capacity of 260mA h g(-1) at 20 degrees C, with a fading of less than 16% after 600 cycles and less than 22% even after 1000 cycles.","5381":"This paper presents our studies on surface modification of silicone elastomer by collagen grafting\/coating and electron beam irradiation.

Schemes for corrosion protection of semiconductor photoelectrodes such as silicon using deposited layers were proposed and attempted for several decades, but increased operational lifetimes were either insufficient or the resulting penalties for device efficiency were prohibitive. In recent years, advances in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin coatings have made novel materials engineering possible, leading to substantial and simultaneous improvements in stability and efficiency of photoelectrochemical cells. The self-limiting, layer-by-layer growth of ALD makes thin films with low pinhole densities possible and may also provide a path to defect control that can generalize this protection technology to a large set of materials necessary to fully realize photoelectrochemical cell technology for artificial photosynthesis.","5658":"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel microspheres of controlled sizes and narrow size distribution were fabricated via electrospraying. To facilitate the formation of microspheres through electrospraying, the gelation time of PEG hydrogels by Michael's addition reaction between acrylate and thiol were optimized. The effect of electrospraying parameters such as applied voltage, flow rate, needle gauge, and tip to collector distance (TTCD) on Taylor cone formation and microsphere size and distribution was determined. Applied voltage and TTCD had the strongest influence on Taylor cone formation and microsphere size and distribution. By careful design of process parameters a wide range of PEG hydrogel microspheres were obtained, namely 70-700 mm in diameter. The biodegradable PEG hydrogel microspheres developed in this study through a combination of mild gelation chemistry and electrospraying will be valuable in a variety of biological applications including drug and protein delivery, cell encapsulation, and biosensors.","1586":"Considering the efficient TiO2 structure on enhancing its photocatalytic behavior is of great interest in recent years. Meanwhile, inhibiting the filtration process for detachment of the catalyst from the purified solution is very advantages. To approach this purpose, TiO2 nanofiber yarns were successfully fabricated through the electrospinning technique using two oppositely charged nozzles followed by the calcinations process from a solution containing titanium precursor and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) as the supporting material. The introduced nanofiber yarns eliminate the ultrasonic and centrifuge steps required in photocatalytic tests of nanoparticles and electrospun nanofibers. The results show that this new catalyst's structure maintains its shape during the photocatalytic degradation process and can be easily removed from the purified water.

A novel method was developed to extract absolute levels of amorphous titania and crystalline anatase and rutile from the synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD) data. This is a sequel to a relative phase concentrations study that has been reported previously by Albetran et al. (Appl Phys A 116: 161 [2014]). Determination of absolute phase levels facilitated estimation of the activation energies for the amorphous-to-anatase transformation of 45(9) kJ\/mol in argon and 69(17) in air, and for the anatase-to-rutile transformation energies of 97(7) kJ\/mol for argon and 129(5) for air. An activation energy estimate for amorphous-to-crystalline titania in argon of 142(21) kJ\/mol, achieved using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), is consistent with the SRD results. The differences in phase transition and activation energies when the titania nanofibers are heated in argon is attributed to the presence of substantial oxygen vacancies in anatase. Estimates of anatase and rutile oxygen site occupancies from the SRD data show that anatase has discernible oxygen vacancies in argon, which correspond to stoichiometric TiO2-x with x < 0.4 that the anatase stoichiometry in air is TiO2. Rutile does not have significant oxygen vacancies in either argon or air.","4056":"Carbon microtube\/graphene (CMT\/GR) hybrid structures were prepared from a natural biomass material (absorbent cotton) by the carbonization and continuous chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of graphene at 1200 degrees C. The graphene nanosheets deposited by CVD had a few-layer structure and were uniformly coated on the surface of the CMTs. The CMT\/GR composite had a hollow tubular structure, a specific surface area of about 312 m(2) g(-1) and was highly hydrophobic (contact angle about 128 degrees). The CMT\/GR hybrid acted as a thermally conductive supporting framework and organic octadecanoic acid (OA) was easily impregnated into the CMT\/GR structure by capillary forces. The CMT\/GR\/OA composite had a thermal conductivity of about 0.69 W m(-1) K-1 at a CMT\/GR loading fraction of about 10 wt%, which is about 4.3 times larger than that of OA (about 0.16 W m(-1) K-1). The CMT\/GR\/OA composite had a high heat storage capacity of about 174 J g(-1), very close to the value of OA (about 186 J g(-1)) and showed good thermal reliability even after 500 melting\/freezing cycles. This method produces novel shape-stabilized phase change materials for use in thermal energy storage applications and has given new insights into the design and preparation of CMT\/GR hybrid structures from natural resources.","2317":"The objective of lung gene therapy is to reach the respiratory epithelial cells in order to deliver a functional nucleic acid sequence. To improve the synthetic carrier's efficacy, knowledge of their biodistribution and elimination pathways, as well as cellular barriers faced, depending on the administration route, is necessary. Indeed, the in vivo fate guides the adaptation of their chemical structure and formulation to increase their transfection capacity while maintaining their tolerance. With this goal, lipidic fluorescent probes were synthesized and formulated with cationic lipophosphoramidate KLN47 (KLN: Karine Le Ny). We found that such formulations present constant compaction properties and similar transfection results without inducing additional cytotoxicity. Next, biodistribution profiles of pegylated and unpegylated lipoplexes were compared after systemic injection in mice. Pegylation of complexes led to a prolonged circulation in the bloodstream, whereas their in vivo bioluminescent expression profiles were similar. Moreover, systemic administration of pegylated lipoplexes resulted in a transient liver toxicity. These results indicate that these new fluorescent compounds could be added into lipoplexes in small amounts without perturbing the transfection capacities of the formulations. Such additional properties allow exploration of the in vivo biodistribution profiles of synthetic carriers as well as the expression intensity of the reporter gene.","2002":"DNA phase transitions are often induced by the addition of condensation agents or by dry concentration. Herein, we show that the non-equilibrium setting of a moderate heat flow across a water-filled chamber separates and gelates DNA strands with single-base resolution. A dilute mix of DNA with two slightly different gel-forming sequences separates into sequence-pure hydrogels under constant physiological solvent conditions. A single base change in a 36 mer DNA inhibits gelation. Only sequences with the ability to form longer strands are concentrated, further elongated, and finally gelated by length-dependent thermal trapping. No condensation agents, such as multivalent ions, were added. Equilibrium aggregates from dry concentration did not show any sequence separation. RNA is expected to behave identically owing to its equal thermophoretic properties. The highly sequence-specific phase transition points towards new possibilities for non-equilibrium origins of life.","3289":"Ferrite being a compound derived from iron oxides including magnetite and hematite possesses similar properties as ceramics which are hard and brittle. Certainly, the mounting demand for electronics has been a major factor driving the exponential growth of ferrite based materials. ZnO doped strontium-natural nanoferrites of composition (80 - x) Fe2O3:xZnO:20SrCO(3), where x = 0, 10, 20 mol% are synthesized and sintered via the solid state reaction scheme. Samples are characterized by SEM, XRD, VSM, and VNA measurements to determine the impact of ZnO contents' variation on the surface morphology, structure, magnetic and microwave absorption properties. The Nicolson-Ross-Weir method is applied to evaluate samples' reflection loss. The average grain size of the strontium ferrite is found to reduce with the increase in ZnO concentration. Materials sintered at 1100 degrees C without ZnO incorporation are composed of hexagonal SrFe12O19. Meanwhile, the addition of ZnO produces cubic ZnFe2O4 and SrFeO2 phases. Insertion of ZnO results in reduction of magnetic parameters and reflection loss. Furthermore, the anisotropy magnetic field of strontium natural ferrites displays a rapid drop from 350 kA\/m to 79.6 kA\/m with the increase in ZnO. Strontium ferrite containing 20 mol% of ZnO exhibits superior microwave absorption with reflection loss within -45 dB to -55.94 dB in the frequency range of 7-13 GHz. This facilely synthesized a new class of materials which is believed to be economically promising for microwave absorption applications in the GHz range. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Molybdenum disulfide\/polyaniline (MoS2\/PANI) is prepared by in situ polymerization. Graphene oxide is well-dispersed by loading MoS2\/PANI nanoparticles (50-80 nm in size) and reduced using urea via a hydrothermal treatment, achieving the ternary nanocomposite.

Lowering the reducing temperature by using CaH2 is essential to keep the well-defined morphology of the starting nanoparticles intact. Surface modification with a silane coupling agent which has COOH groups has led to excellent aqueous dispersibility that facilitates subsequent functionalization with a variety of molecules via well-established processes such as EDC\/NHS chemistry.

By combining defect-free graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and microcrystalline cellulose, lightweight cellulose\/GNP aerogels are fabricated and their highly porous but strong three-dimensional networks benefit the encapsulation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and prevent the leakage of PEG above its melting point. Phase change composites are prepared by vacuum-assisted impregnating of PEG into the cellulose\/GNP aerogels, which exhibit high thermal conductivity, good shape stability and high latent heat of fusion. Even compressed upon the melting point of PEG, the phase change composites keep their shapes stable without any leakage. With only 5.3 wt% of GNPs, the composite exhibits a high thermal conductivity of 1.35 W m(-1) K-1, 463% higher than that of the composite without GNPs. The highly porous cellulose network and the low loading of highly thermally conductive GNPs are responsible for the high loading of PEG in the composite with a satisfactory latent heat of fusion of 156.1 J g(-1).

An important role in the efficient exploitation of the geothermal resource is played by the grouting material placed in the borehole between the pipes and the ground. Actually, the use of proper grouts is essential to provide an effective heat transfer between the ground and the heat carrier fluid in the pipes, and also to comply with the mechanical and environmental demands. However, when it comes to the construction of the GHP installations, the grout is especially required to be easy to work with (workable) and for this reason more water than required is sometimes added. In order to assess the suitability of grouting materials with significant water\/solid ratios, the thermal conductivity, mechanical strength and permeability of five different grouts and grout-pipe specimens were measured for their laboratory characterization. In addition, the grouts were subjected to heating and cooling cycles to evaluate their durability with time in terms of the potential degradation of the materials and the loss of quality of the grout-pipe interface. According to the results obtained, the grouts here tested are appropriate for most of the geothermal heat pump installations, especially for those with low to medium ground thermal properties.

Silver selenide nanoparticles were synthesized using tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) as solvent and tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as capping environment. Silver selenide was prepared by reacting silver nitrate and selenium with tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) to form TOP-Ag and TOP-Se solutions. Both absorption and emission spectra signify the formation of nanoparticles as well as the TEM which revealed spherical particles with an average particle size of 22 nm. The polymer, PVP used was prepared at concentrations ranging from (35 to 45 wt%) and the TOPO-capped silver selenide nanoparticles (0.2 and 0.6 wt%) were incorporated into them and electrospun by varying the voltage from 11 to 20 kV. The SEM images of the Ag2Se\/PVP composite fibers revealed the fibers of diameters with average values of 425 and 461 nm. The X-ray diffraction results show peaks which were identified due to alpha-Ag2Se body centered cubic compound. The sharp peak observed for all the samples at 2 theta=44.5 suggest the presence of Ag in the face centered cubic which can be attributed to higher concentration of silver nitrate used with molar ratio of selenium to silver and the abundance of silver in the silver selenide crystal.

It has been shown previously that organo-modified silicene can be synthesized with phenyl groups covalently bonded to both sides of the nanosheet, with hydrogen atoms terminating the undercoordinated silicon atoms (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 5946-5947; Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011, 13, 15418-15422). In this work, we use density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the effect of hydroxyl (OH) group substitution on the phenyl-modified silicene. We show that van der Waals forces need to be included in the simulation to represent the interactions between the groups on the nanosheet. Different positions of the OH groups on the phenyl rings were modeled including ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted positions. The para-substituted position was favored, followed by the meta- then ortho-substituted positions. Our ab initio MD simulations showed that the phenol groups will freely rotate on the nanosheet, aligning so as to form hydrogen bonds between adjacent phenol groups. Such a property may allow the material to be soluble in aqueous solutions, extending its application areas.","4328":"Artificial photosynthesis represents one of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century, offering the possibility of clean energy through water photolysis and renewable chemicals through CO2 utilisation as a sustainable feedstock.

To design strategies that could interfere with the endogenous production of such aldehydes or promote their detoxification or, alternatively, to develop therapeutic procedures that could inhibit the deleterious effects of the oxoaldehydes at the cellular level, it is important to characterize the wide spectrum of reactions between these compounds and biomolecules, and gain insight into their mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the reactivity of endogenous alpha-oxoaldehyde, methylglyoxal, and of malonaldehyde towards amino acid derivatives, and we identified new adducts with N-a-acetyllysine and N-a-acetylhistidine. In addition, we showed that a structurally analogous adduct is also formed with the model peptide N-acetylglycyllysine O-methyl ester. The characterized compounds were most likely derived from the addition of the appropriate nucleophilic center of the studied biomolecules to the C=C bond of the initially formed aldehyde conjugate. The resulted adducts contain an electrophilic beta-dicarbonyl moiety and could potentially be involved in the formation of DNA-protein or protein cross-links.","6096":"Tough fibrous membranes for smoke filtration have been developed from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles by solution electrospinning. The fibre thicknesses were controlled from 0.4 to 4.3 mu m by adjustment of the spinning conditions. The highest fibre strength and toughness were obtained for fibres with an average diameter of 1.0 mu m, 62.5 MPa and 65.8 MJ m(-3), respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fibres showed a skewed amorphous halo, whereas the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed an apparent crystallinity of 6-8% for the 0.4 and 1 mu m fibres and 0.2% crystallinity for the 4.3 mu m fibres. Heat shrinkage experiments were conducted by exposing the fibres to a temperature above their glass transition temperature (T-g). The test revealed a remarkable capability of the thinnest fibres to shrink by 50%, which was in contrast to the 4.3 mu m fibres, which displayed only 4% shrinkage. These thinner fibres aka showed a significantly higher glass transition temperature (+15 degrees C) than that of the 4.3 mu m fibres. The results suggested an internal morphology with a high degree of molecular orientation in the amorphous segments along the thinner fibres, consistent with a constrained mesomorphic phase formed during their rapid solidification in the electric field. Air filtration was demonstrated with cigarette smoke as a model substance passed through the fibre mats. The 0.4 mu m fibres showed the most effective smoke filtration and a capacity to absorb 43x its own weight in smoke residuals. whereas the 1 mu m fibres showed the best combination of filtration capacity (32x) and mechanical robustness. The use of recycled PET in the form of nanofibres is a novel way of turning waste into higher-value products.","2821":"There is a growing need to utilize lignin (i.e., wasted material) from the pulping industry in the production of value-added products and to develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly processes for removing dyes from wastewater effluents. In this context, lignin can be modified to gain anionic charges, which can successfully remove cationic dyes from wastewater. In this study, lignin was extracted from thermomechanical pulp (softwood) via periodate treatment, and then the extracted lignin was oxidized using 30 wt % nitric acid concentration at 80 degrees C for 1.5 h, which resulted in oxidized lignin with the charge density and solubility of 3.02 mequiv\/g and 97% (at a 1 wt % lignin concentration), respectively. The oxidized lignin was used for removing ethyl violet and basic blue cationic dyes from simulated wastewater effluents. It was observed that the dye removals were in the ranges of 70-80 wt % for ethyl violet and of 80-95 wt % for basic blue, while the COD removals were in the ranges of 60-70% for ethyl violet and 70-85% for basic blue when the concentrations of dyes varied between 50 and 400 mg\/L. The dye removal was pH dependent, and the removal of basic blue decreased from 84 wt % (in the absence of salt) to 77% in the presence of 3 g\/L NaCl, whereas salt had a marginal effect on the removal of ethyl violet from the solution.","6973":"The discovery and synthesis of novel multifunctional organic building blocks for nanoparticles is challenging.

This approach, inspired by the natural phenomena of tears of wine, works by regulating the hydrodynamics of the material comprising of droplets during spray-pyrolysis. In contrast to conventional spray-pyrolysis where droplets dry independently and form a rough morphology, the use of binary solvent system creates localized surface tension gradients that initiate Marangoni flows, thus directing the incoming droplets to spontaneously undergo coalescing, merging and spreading into a continuous wet films before drying. By systematically exploring the dynamics of spreading and drying, we achieve spray-coated perovskite photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency of 14.2%, a near two-fold improvement than that of the spray-pyrolysis counterpart. Of particular significance is the fact that the single pass deposition technique unveils novel inroads in efficient management of lead consumption during deposition.","5716":"Graphene-containing layer-by-layer (LbL) electrodes are promising for thin film electrochemical energy storage. However, common practice centers on assembly with chemically reduced graphene oxide sheets, which have a tendency to severely aggregate during processing. More direct and facile is the LbL assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and their subsequent electrochemical reduction. Here, we demonstrate porous (void fraction = 0.625) LbL electrodes comprised of electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) sheets and polyaniline nanofibers (PANI NFs) for use in non-aqueous energy storage systems. Our approach is also promising for deposition onto complex surfaces, as demonstrated here by the successful assembly onto cotton fabric. Both PANI NFs and ERGO sheets store charge, bear conductivity, and provide a highly porous architecture, which facilitates the mass transport of ions. The nature of PANI NF\/GO LbL assembly and growth is first presented, which we find to be affected by assembly pH. The confirmation of the electrochemical reduction step is then discussed, followed by the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrodes in a non-aqueous lithium metal battery. Capacity varies from 85 to 184 mA h cm(-3) (188 to 461 mA h g(-1)) at 0.1 A g(-1) (electrode mass basis), depending on the electrode thickness. The highest specific energy measured was 1395 mW h g(-1) at a specific power of 1590 mW g(-1), and the highest specific power was 60 252 mW g(-1) at a specific energy of 927 mW h g(-1). These results demonstrate that electroactive polyaniline nanofiber\/graphene coatings from aqueous layer-by-layer assembly are attainable for energy storage.","6918":"First time, polyacrylonitrile (PAN)\/Ag2CO3 composite nanofibers (NFs) with uniformly distributed Ag2CO3 nanoparticles (NPs) inside polyacrylonitrile NFs were fabricated via simple and versatile technique; electrospinning of colloidal solution of PAN and Ag2CO3 NPs. In this work, Ag2CO3 NPs were synthesized by ion-exchange method between Ag(NH3) (2) (+) and NaHCO3. The experimental result demonstrated that PAN\/Ag2CO3 composite NFs with average diameter of approximately 430 nm can exhibit good photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of methyl red under visible light irradiation. In addition, thus obtained composite NFs displayed enhanced antibacterial activities toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria due to its photogenerated electron-hole pairs indicating that this sort of material may represent a new, promising alternative with a wide range of potential application in the field of water treatment.","743":"Nanofibers are characterized with unique electronic, magnetic and optical properties, due to their extremely high aspect ratio and large specific surface area. Assembly of nanofibers with predesigned macro architectures is a key step toward practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the scalable oriented assembly of nanofibers based on electrospinning, and explore their potential application in constructing optically anisotropic films. By the post soaking-and-drying approach, the nonwoven films assembled by oriented polymer nanofibers can be readily converted to flexible films with high transparency, which show optical transmission contrast exceeding 0.9 in the visible to near infrared region. The method for preparation of optically anisotropic films proposed here circumvents the sophisticated dye-doping and thermal drawing processes which are inevitable in conventional approaches. Considering the scalability potential of the electrospinning technique, the method demonstrated here is promising for industrial production of film polarizers.","994":"Piezoresistive polymer nanocomposites are highly desirable for flexible mechanical sensing applications. In this study, a family of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)\/elastomeric triisocyanate-crosslinked polytetrahydrofuran (ETC-PTHF) nanocomposites that are highly stretchable and highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli were designed, synthesized, and characterized. The CNTs in the CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites were initially dispersed in the ETC-PTHF matrix uniformly, leading to a relatively high electrical conductivity. Upon stretching, both the degree of CNT alignment along the stretching direction and the degree of PTHF crystallinity increased consistently with the tensile strain. The strain-induced microstructure change adversely affected the CNT conducting pathways, thereby reducing the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites. For instance, the electrical conductivity of the 15 wt% CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites decreased by approximately 7.3%, 29.2%, and 19.76, 169.2 and 1291 times when the tensile strain was 1%, 5%, 50%, 250%, and 500%, respectively. The nanocomposite film was able to detect a mechanical stimulus (poking) weaker than the landing force of a mosquito. Furthermore, the nanocomposite film demonstrated rapid and highly sensitive responses to continuous finger motion. These new piezoresistive CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites possess a number of desirable characteristics including ease of fabrication, low cost, and high sensitivity, thereby making them very promising candidates for applications in electronic skins, electronic textiles, and biomedical detectors.","4352":"This study evaluated the effect of using acetylated nanofibrillated cellulose (ANFC) and acetylated pulp (AP) fibers to modify strength and barrier properties of paper. Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) was produced using an ultra-fine friction grinder. The NFC and pulp fibers were modified by the heterogeneous acetylation process. Chemical modification was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy together with titration. The values of density, burst strength, tensile strength, and air resistance were increased by adding NFC and ANFC to the paper combination. Addition of NFC to the non-acetylated pulp had no significant effect on the water absorption of made paper (p > 0.05), while addition of ANFC to the non-acetylated pulp led to a decrease in the water absorption of about 23.1%. The results indicated that addition of partially acetylated NFC to the pulp caused an improvement in both the air and water barrier and mechanical strength properties of the paper, simultaneously.","2470":"Today's scientific advances in water desalination dramatically increase our ability to transform seawater into fresh water. As an important source of renewable energy, solar power holds great potential to drive the desalination of seawater. Previously, solar assisted evaporation systems usually relied on highly concentrated sunlight or were not suitable to treat seawater or wastewater, severely limiting the large scale application of solar evaporation technology. Thus, a new strategy is urgently required in order to overcome these problems. In this study, we developed a solar thermal evaporation system based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Because this material can absorb over 95% of sunlight, we achieved high evaporation efficiency up to 70% under only 1 kW m(-2) irradiation. Moreover, it could be separated from seawater under the action of magnetic force by decorated with MNPs. Thus, this system provides an advantage of recyclability, which can significantly reduce the material consumptions. Additionally, by using photoabsorbing bulk or layer materials, the deposition of solutes offen occurs in pores of materials during seawater desalination, leading to the decrease of efficiency. However, this problem can be easily solved by using MNPs, which suggests this system can be used in not only pure water system but also high-salinity wastewater system. This study shows good prospects of graphene-based materials for seawater desalination and high-salinity wastewater treatment.","4734":"High-quality single-crystal ZnO nanowire arrays with diameter ranging from 30 to 110 nm were synthesized using a two-step process: (1) synthesis of ZnO thin film by sol-gel technique, which was used as seed layer, and (2) oriented ZnO nanowire arrays were grown on ZnO seed layer using a hydrothermal reaction process at a low temperature of 90 degrees C. Experimental results reveal an ultrahigh sensitivity of similar to 98% to 100 ppm of H-2 gas and 93% to 200 ppm of CO gas, an ultrafast recovery of 1 to 2 ms to CO gas with high repeatability. The current transients demonstrate the reversible type sensing to reducing gas (H-2 or CO) detection using as grown ZnO nanowire arrays sensor. The hydrothermally grown ZnO nanowire-array-based gas sensors may have potential application in industry without much modification.","3467":"Recently, electrospinning technology has been widely used as a processing method to make nanofiber sheets (NS) for biomedical applications because of its unique features, such as ease of fabrication and high surface area. To develop a sustained dexamethasone (Dex) delivery system, in this work, poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-l-lactide) (PCLA) copolymer with controllable biodegradability was synthesized and further utilized to prepare electrospun Dex-loaded NS using water-insoluble Dex (Dex(b)) or water-soluble Dex (Dex(s)). The Dex-NS obtained by electrospinning exhibited randomly oriented and interconnected fibrillar structures. The in vitro and in vivo degradation of Dex-NS was confirmed over a period of a few weeks by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The evaluation of in vitro and in vivo Dex(b) and Dex(s) release from Dex-NS showed an initial burst of Dex(b) at day 1 and, thereafter, almost the same amount of release as Dex(b) for up to 28 days. In contrast, Dex(s)-NS exhibited a small initial burst of Dex(s) and a first-order releasing profile from Dex-NS. In conclusion, Dex-NS exhibited sustained in vitro and in vivo Dex(s) release for a prolonged period, as well as controlled biodegradation of the NS over a defined treatment period.","4453":"Carbon nanospheres (CNSs) are prepared with natural gas as a carbon source. The resulting sample as an anode material for LIBs delivers a reversible capacity of 552 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.05 A g(-1) with an initial coulombic efficiency of 68%. Moreover, the rate capability is evaluated at different current densities from 0.05 to 5 A g(-1), and the coulombic efficiency can still be maintained above 90% after 300 cycles.","5668":"In this work, we report a novel method of layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition using concentration tubes that enables faster process and less damage to fragile nanocores than previously described methods. Such methods are generally based on continuous cycles of centrifugation\/resuspension for long times and at high speeds, which may eventually lead to the aggregation of the deflocculated suspension of nanoparticles into a compact, non-resuspendable cake. The new method was applied to the preparation of a double-chambered nanocarrier system, which was successfully loaded with a fluorescently labeled model protein (lysozyme) and a model small molecule (fluorescein) in two defined and separate compartments, namely the poly lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) core (approximate to 110 nm) and an outer shell obtained by LbL surface coating. The new method yielded stable suspensions of drug-loaded, LbL-coated PLGA nanoparticles, while centrifugation at high speeds and long time intervals leads to a compact cake of non-resuspendable aggregates. These nanocarriers were taken up by MDCK cells in vitro, where a colocalization of both model compounds was shown by confocal imaging.

We created a TiO2 nanoparticle composite with a densely multi-layered AR system top layer to demonstrate its eco-sustainable, hydrophilic performance and to act as a low refractive index material, which is essential for AR. The hydrophilic system displayed the lowest reflectance and a remarkable contact angle reduction to 0 degrees under UV light irradiation. The annealed hydrophilic system (the eco-sustainable system) exhibited the highest photodecomposition activity of 100% within 90 min by effective separation of electron-hole pairs using SiOx nanoparticles inside the TiO2 layer as trap levels. The successful AR, hydrophilic, and eco-sustainable characteristics of the simplified system composed of only two materials, TiO2 and SiOx, are anticipated to contribute to the enhancement of photovoltaic system efficiency.","5458":"Superplasticizers are a class of anionic polymer dispersants used to inhibit aggregation in hydraulic cement, lowering the yield stress of cement pastes to improve workability and reduce water requirements. The plant-derived biopolymer lignin is commonly used as a low-cost\/low-performance plasticizer, but attempts to improve its effects on cement rheology through copolymerization with synthetic monomers have not led to significant improvements. Here we demonstrate that kraft lignin can form the basis for high-performance superplasticizers in hydraulic cement, but the molecular architecture must be based on a lignin core with a synthetic-polymer corona that can be produced via controlled radical polymerization. Using slump tests of ordinary Portland cement pastes, we show that polyacrylamidegrafted lignin prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization can reduce the yield stress of cement paste to similar levels as a leading commercial polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer at concentrations ten-fold lower, although the lignin material produced via controlled radical polymerization does not appear to reduce the dynamic viscosity of cement paste as effectively as the polycarboxylate superplasticizer, despite having a similar affinity for the individual mineral components of ordinary Portland cement. In contrast, polyacrylamide copolymerized with a methacrylated kraft lignin via conventional free radical polymerization having a similar overall composition did not reduce the yield stress or the viscosity of cement pastes. While further work is required to elucidate the mechanism of this effect, these results indicate that controlling the architecture of polymer-grafted lignin can significantly enhance its performance as a superplasticizer for cement.","2453":"Free radical induced redox reaction kinetics and mechanism of tetrahydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (THQ) has been studied using pulse radiolysis technique. THQ efficiently scavenged hydrated electron, superoxide radical anion, ethanol radical, hydroxyl radical, azidyl radical, thiocyanate radical anion, sulfate radical anion, haloperoxyl radical, lipid peroxyl radical, tryptophanyl radical and tyrosyl radical. Transient absorption spectra of THQ semiquinone radical anion, THQ radical cation and THQ radical produced with these free radicals and rate constants for these reactions have been studied. A probable mechanism of free radical induced redox reactions of THQ has been proposed. Reaction of THQ with free radicals and cyclic voltammetry measurements suggest its oxidation potentials at 0.81 V and 0.94 V vs NHE. To the best of our knowledge, free radical reactions of THQ have been reported for the first time.","7111":"We report the fabrication of oriented nano-ferrofibres using a typical electrospinning process in the absence of an applied magnetic field to assist alignment. For this, a double surfacted magnetic fluid was used to optimise and enhance the charging and thereby alignment of the fibres. The induced electric field in the PVA solution assists the orientation of magnetic nanoparticles inside the fibres. The microwave resonance studies show that the ferrofibres obtained have high magnetisation values (1.2-3.7 emu g(-1)) and uniaxial anisotropy with high effective anisotropy field values.","6822":"A naturally occurring pigment emodin is reported here as an example to extend mechanochromic luminescent material systems. Three polymorphs, two hydrates and the amorphous state of emodin, are successfully synthesized. These solid forms exhibit significantly different fluorescence properties, which indicates its potential application in mechano-sensors and security papers.","69":"Three biocompatible polymers, polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran and chitosan, have been used in this work to control the colloidal stability of magnetic nanoparticles (14 +\/- 5 nm in diameter) and to vary the aggregation state in order to study their effect on relaxometric and heating properties. Two different coating strategies have been deeply developed; one based on the formation of an amide bond between citric acid coated nanoparticles (NPs) and amine groups present on the polymer surface and the other based on the NP encapsulation. Relaxometric properties revealed that proton relaxation rates strongly depend on the coating layer hydrophilicity and the aggregation state of the particles due to the presence of magnetic interactions. Thus, while PEG coating reduces particle aggregation by increasing inter-particle spacing leading to reduction of both T-1 and T-2 relaxation, dextran and chitosan lead to an increase mainly in T-2 values due to the aggregation of particles in bigger clusters where they are in close contact. Dextran and chitosan coated NPs have also shown a remarkable heating effect during the application of an alternating magnetic field. They have proved to be potential candidates as theranostic agents for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, cytotoxicity of PEG conjugated NPs, which seem to be ideal for intravenous administration because of their small hydrodynamic size, was investigated resulting in high cell viability even at 0.2 mg Fe ml(-1) after 24 h of incubation. This suspension can be used as drug\/biomolecule carrier for in vivo applications.","1582":"Chiral nematic mesoporous phenol-formaldehyde resins, which were prepared using cellulose nanocrystals as a template, can be used as a substrate to produce latent photonic images. These resins undergo swelling, which changes their reflected color. By writing on the films with chemical inks, the density of methylol groups in the resin changes, subsequently affecting their degree of swelling and, consequently, their color. Writing on the films gives latent images that are revealed only upon swelling of the films. Using inkjet printing, it is possible to make higher resolution photonic patterns both as text and images that can be visualized by swelling and erased by drying. This novel approach to printing photonic patterns in resin films may be applied to anti-counterfeit tags, signage, and decorative applications.","4751":"Some properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be easily measured directly on whole waters, while others require sample concentration and removal of natural salts. To increase CDOM content and eliminate salts, solid phase extraction (SPE) is often employed. Biases following extraction and elution are inevitable, thus raising the question of how truly representative the extracted material is of the original. In this context, we investigated the wavelength dependence of extraction efficiency for C18 cartridges with respect to CDOM optical properties using samples obtained from the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (EAO). Further, we compared the optical changes of C18 extracts and the corresponding whole water following chemical reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). C18 cartridges preferentially extracted long-wavelength absorbing\/emitting material for samples impacted by riverine input. Extraction efficiency overall decreased with offshore distance away from riverine input. Spectral slopes of C18-OM samples were also almost always lower than those of their corresponding CDOM samples supporting the preferential extraction of higher molecular weight absorbing material. The wavelength dependence of the optical properties (absorption, fluorescence emission, and quantum yield) of the original water samples and their corresponding extracted material were very similar. C18 extracts and corresponding water samples further exhibited comparable optical changes following NaBH4 reduction, thus suggesting a similarity in nature (structure) of the optically active extracted material, independent of geographical locale. Altogether, these data suggested a strong similarity between C18 extracts and corresponding whole waters, thus indicating that extracts are representative of the CDOM content of original waters.","4041":"A comparative approach for the surface silylation of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) in water is proposed through an environmentally friendly sol-gel route based on alkoxysilanes. NFC suspensions were freeze-dried under controlled conditions in the presence of methyltrimethoxysilane used as a model alkoxysilane. Two different protocols that involve different pH values (0.4 and 4) and post-treatment procedures were investigated and compared. Protocol 1 led to a network of nanofibrils in which polysiloxane particles were dispersed, and protocol 2 produced a scaffold of cellulosic fibrils coated by a polysiloxane layer bonded firmly to the cellulosic substrate. Different from protocol 1, protocol 2 imparted the cellulosic material with hydrophobic properties and improved its thermal stability. Moreover, if 1 wt% of fibrils treated by protocol 2 were incorporated into a model polydimethylsiloxane network, substantial improvements of the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the composite were noted.","5914":"Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) has been used extensively for numerous biomedical applications. However, there is not enough information in the literature on the wettability and hygroscopic properties of electrospun PNIPAM fibers, relevant for water harvesting applications. This study focuses on investigating the wettability and hygroscopic properties of electrospun PNIPAM fibers at room temperature and elevated temperature. The wettability properties of electrospun PNIPAM fibers were compared to spin-coated PNIPAM thin films. The wettability properties of the electrospun fibers were enhanced by 56% compared to spin-coated films. Water contact angle (WCA) measured on electrospun fibers was determined to be 137 degrees at elevated temperatures while WCA on spin cast PNIPAM film was determined to be 81 degrees at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, hygroscopic properties of the electrospun PNIPAM fibers were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The PNIPAM fibers are seen to exhibit moisture absorption capacity of about 16.6 wt. % under humid conditions.","6596":"Lots of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have become important additives for improving the anticorrosion performance of epoxy coatings for steel structures. In this paper, a 2D MoS2 nanosheet was prepared and treated by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) to fabricate 2D MoS2\/SDBS composite (2D-MSC) coating on carbon steel. The anticorrosion performance of the coating was comprehensively investigated by contact angle, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-CT scanning technology and long-term salt spray test. The results showed that 2D-MSC could fill in the natural pores of the epoxy coating, decrease the penetration rate of the corrosive medium into the coating and effectively inhibit the local corrosion rate. Furthermore, the deep working mechanism of 2D-MSC on the epoxy coating was explored by XPS technology. Correspondingly, physical and chemical models were established to illustrate the role that 2D-MSC plays on the coating according to the characterization results.","3032":"This paper describes the electrokinetic, adsorption and stability properties of the silica-exopolysaccharide Sinorhizobium meliloti (EPS). Exopolysaccharide adsorbs on the silica surface in the whole pH range, but the adsorption amount increases with the pH growth (at pH 9 approx. 0.8 mg\/m(2)). The EPS adsorption affects the electrokinetic and stability properties of the system. At low pH values (3 and 4.6) the increase in the system stability occurs (electrosteric interactions), whereas at higher (7.6 and 9) the light system destabilization was noted (formation of a single polymer bridges between particles).

In this paper, we report a novel electrospinning-calcination-grinding route to prepare well-dispersed inorganic nanoparticles and short nanofibers. Continuous inorganic nanofibers are prepared by calcining the electrospun precursor nanofibers, which are then transformed into nanoparticles or short nanofibers after mild grinding. Due to the continuous fiber shape of the precursor agglomeration is avoided during calcination, and due to the fragile nature the calcined continuous inorganic nanofibers can be made into nanoparticles or short nanofibers easily by short-time mild grinding. On account of the versatility of electrospinning, the present route is applicable to most of the commonly seen materials. Furthermore, short nanofibers which are difficult to prepare for some materials by other conventional methods can be easily obtained by this method. A series of inorganic nanoparticles and short nanofibers have been prepared, including WC, TiC, ATO, W, Ni, and Cu. The prepared suspensions of WC, TiC, and W show outstanding dispersion stability and no sedimentation or flocculation is observed even after several months, indicating high promise for many applications such as printed electronics and three-dimensional (3D) printing.","2418":"Fluorinated graphene hydrogels (FGHs) are synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process and applied as the binder\/additive-free electrode materials for supercapacitors. Along with the reduction of graphene oxide (GO), fluorine atoms incorporate into the graphene framework through the substitution process with the residual phenol, ether or carbonyl groups, forming different fluorine species subsequently. The fluorine content and the C-F bond configuration are easily adjusted by the hydrothermal temperature. X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicate the mainly existent of semi-ionic C-F bonds in the prepared FGHs. The semi-ionic C-F bonds in FGHs facilitate the ion transport, enhance the electrical conductivity and provide active sites for the faradic reaction. Therefore, the electrochemical performances of FGHs are better than the fluorine-free graphene hydrogel prepared by the same hydrothermal process. FGH prepared at the hydrothermal temperature of 150 degrees C exhibit the highest specific capacitance (227 F g(-1)) and the best rate capability. The corresponding symmetric-supercapacitor delivers the power density as high as 50.05 kW Kg(-1) at the current density of 50 A g(-1). These results indicate the FGHs are the ideal electrode materials with the great potential in the field of high-power supercapacitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DC electrical measurements revealed that sample resistance decreases from 10(12) Omega in moderate vacuum to approximately 10(7) Omega at highly water-saturated atmosphere. This behavior is attributed to the creation of water pathways on the cellulose fibers that allow ionic species such as impurities, protons (H+), and dissociated Na+ ions from the CuTsPc molecules, to flow. The contribution of the CuTsPc molecules and their dissociated Na+ ions on the sample resistance was elucidated analyzing the electrical response of bare and printed paper substrates. An increase of relative humidity levels (RH) from 10 % to 40-45 % revealed an increase of current of four orders of magnitude for printed samples, whereas less than one order of magnitude was registered for bare paper substrates. Electrical measurements as a function of temperature have shown that moisture can inhibit the semiconducting properties of CuTsPc. Thermal gravimetric studies revealed that approximately 11 % of mass accounting to the presence of water is released above 70 A degrees C, the same temperature in which the sample recovers its dry-state semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting properties of CuTsPc can also be observed upon white light illumination, whereas the charge carrier extraction is governed by the RH level. These results point out the important role of humidity on the electrical properties of paper-based organic, electronic, and optoelectronic devices.","5137":"Although iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely utilized in molecular imaging and drug delivery studies, they have not been evaluated as carriers for glycoconjugate-based anticancer vaccines. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are attractive targets for the development of anticancer vaccines. Due to the weak immunogenicity of these antigens, it is highly challenging to elicit strong anti-TACA immune responses. With their high biocompatibilities and large surface areas, magnetic NPs were synthesized for TACA delivery. The magnetic NPs were coated with phospholipid-functionalized TACA glycopeptides through hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions without the need for any covalent linkages. Multiple copies of glycopeptides were presented on NPs, potentially leading to enhanced interactions with antibody-secreting B cells through multivalent binding. Mice immunized with the NPs generated strong antibody responses, and the glycopeptide structures important for high antibody titers were identified. The antibodies produced were capable of recognizing both mouse and human tumor cells expressing the glycopeptide, resulting in tumor cell death through complement-mediated cytotoxicities. These results demonstrate that magnetic NPs can be a new and simple platform for multivalently displaying TACA and boosting anti-TACA immune responses without the need for a typical protein carrier.","7063":"Electrospinning uses an electrical charge to draw fine polymer fibers from a liquid. Stable jet stage and whipping instability stage exist in the electrospinning process. It is difficult to control stability of jet motion. Electrospinning with NbFeB permanent magnets is proposed to enhance the stability of jet motion in this paper. This method is very simple and effective. The electrospinning process assisted by magnets was observed by a high-speed camera, and the magnetic field was numerically analyzed by finite element method. The experimental results showed that the stability of jet motion increased obviously. We have explained that the magnets restricted and focused the motion of charges as a magnetic lens and created a uniform electric field distribution as an auxiliary electrode at the end of spinneret. The stable jet length, whipping instability cone angle, and fiber diameter were measured by experiments. The stable jet length increased significantly, the whipping instability cone angle decreased, and the average diameter of fibers increased slightly and distributed more evenly as the magnets were fixed at the end of spinneret.","4747":"Nanostructured TiO2 and TiO2@C nanocomposites were prepared directly from urea-impregnated cellulose by a simple reaction\/diffusion process and evaluated as negative electrode materials for Li and Na batteries. By direct treatment with TiCl4 under anhydrous conditions, the urea impregnation of cellulose impacts both the TiO2 morphology and the carbon left by cellulose after pyrolysis. Hierarchical TiO2 structures with a flower-like morphology grown from-and-at the surface of the cellulose fibers are obtained without any directing agent. The resulting TiO2\/cellulose composite is then transformed either into pure TiO2 flowers by calcination in air at 600 degrees C, or into TiO2@C nanocomposites by pyrolysis under Ar at 600 degrees C. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that both samples can (de)insert lithium and sodium ions and are promising electrode materials.","1467":"The molecular order and orientation significantly influence the physical properties of conjugated polymers and the corresponding performance in electronic devices. The precise synthesis and characterization are the challenges to obtain high quality polymer crystalline micro\/nanostructures, on the basis of which, the charge transport mechanisms can be discussed and the device performance can be improved. A micro-fibrous complex of conductive polymer and natural polysaccharide has been formed during the in situ polymerization of aniline in the aqueous solution of kappa-carrageenan. With the template of the polyanion, aniline is polymerized and polyaniline (PAN!) chain grows in the vicinity of sulfonic acid groups. Through the comprehensive characterizations of UV-vis spectra, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analysis, the assembly structure of the interpolymer complex has been illuminated, i.e., oligomers of PANI with expanded conformation are formed, the electrostatic interaction between the protonated PANI oligomers and anionic kappa-carrageenan makes the chains of PAN! and kappa-carrageenan bound together, and a micro-fibrous complex is formed with enhanced orientation of both PANI and kappa-carrageenan, leading to an enhanced conductivity of the complex. The glucose biosensor made of the complex shows high detecting sensitivity and broad linear range in the recognition of the glucose due to its high conductivity and good compatibility with the enzyme.

However, the molecular details of the binding mechanism between SBD and plasma membrane domains remain unclear. Here, to investigate how the peptide recognizes the lipid surface at an atomically detailed level, SBD peptides in the environment of raft-like bilayers were examined in micro-seconds-long molecular dynamics simulations. We found that SBD adopted a coil-helix-coil structural motif, which binds to multiple GT1b gangliosides via salt bridges and CH- interactions. Our simulation results demonstrate that the CH- and electrostatic forces between SBD monomers and GT1b gangliosides clusters are the main driving forces in the binding process. The presence of the fluorescent dye and linker molecules do not change the binding mechanism of SBD probes with gangliosides, which involves the helix-turn-helix structural motif that was suggested to constitute a glycolipid binding domain common to some sphingolipid interacting proteins, including HIV gp120, prion, and A.","3258":"The study aimed to illustrate application of polycation Stealth nanogels for sustained delivery of methotrexate (MTX) in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model in C57Bl\/6 mice. Nanogel synthesis involves metal ion coordinated self-assembly of PEGylated poly ethyleneimine (L-histidine substituted), chemical crosslinking and subsequent removal of the coordinated metal. The nanogels were characterized by TEM and DLS-zeta potential. Comparative efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the i.v. administred MTX-loaded nanogels were investigated in the CIA model. Inflammation site passive accumulation of the fluorophore-labeled nanogels was tested using in-vivo imaging of mice paw received unilateral injection of lipopolysaccharide. Uniform nanogels (sizes similar to 40 nm by TEM) were loaded with MTX (entrapment efficiency = 62% and drug loading = 54% at the MTX feeding ratio of 0.3 relative to total molar concentration of the polymer amines). The nanogels exhibited neutral surface charge and an acceptable biocompatibility in terms of albumin aggregation, hemolysis, erythrocyte aggregation and cytotoxicity. Single dose pharmacokinetics of the MTX-loaded nanogels, unlike free drug, showed a sustained plasma profile. When arthritis established as confirmed by histopathology, a remarkable decline of paw swelling and clinical scores was observed. Fluorescence intensity of the nanogels was enhanced about 2.7 folds at the inflamed than control normal ankle. Sustained delivery of MTX and preferential accumulation of the nanogels in inflamed paw might explain the superior clinical outcome of the MTX-loaded nanogels.","5929":"This study described a method for enhancing the durability of amino-naphthoquinones embedded on cotton fabrics by creating aldehyde groups in the molecular structure of cotton cellulose. These aldehyde groups undergo intermolecular coupling with the amino group to form imines whereby naphthoquinones are covalently bonded to the cotton cellulose. The results suggest that these antibacterial compounds are tightly bound to the cotton fabric and impart to the fabric antibacterial properties, which retain their antibacterial activity after 15 laundry cycles. Such type of antimicrobial finish can find wide application in the health and hygiene textile sector.","2759":"Sweetness is a traditional sensory indicator used to evaluate the quality of the popular Chinese herb Radix Astragali (RA). RA roots with strong sweetness are considered to be of good quality. However, neither a thorough analysis of the component(s) contributing to RA sweetness, nor a scientific investigation of the reliability of this indicator has been conducted to date. In this study, seven kinds of sweetness components were identified in RA and a quality evaluation method based on these components was established and used to characterize the quality of 48 RA samples. The sweetness evaluation method of RA was first built based on the sweetness components, and a comprehensive evaluation index commonly used in quality control of RA was also derived, which was based on the contents of four indicators (astragaloside IV, calycosin glucoside, polysaccharides and extracts). After evaluating the correlation of these indexes the results showed that the level of sweetness exhibited a strong positive correlation with the proposed comprehensive index. Our results indicate that sweetness is one of the most important quality attributes of RA and thus provide a scientific basis for the utility of the sweetness indicator in quality assessment of this Chinese herb.","3411":"To reduce costs and improve practicability, an ion imprinted magnetic chitosan (IMCS) was synthesized through co-precipitation using steel pickling waste liquor and chitosan and Cu(II) as template ions, which was then characterized by TEM, SEM, EDX, FTIR, XRD and VSM. The batch experiments were carried out for its potential application and high selectivity of Cu(II) removal, which were observed due to the paramagnetic properties and coordination reactions in the imprinted cavities. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process followed a pseudo second-order model and the equilibrium data fit perfectly with the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 109.89 mg g(-1). Negative values for Delta H-0 and Delta G(0) indicated an exothermic and spontaneous adsorption process. The adsorption process was found to be a chemical reaction and coordination complexes were formed between the metal ions and the groups of chitosan binding mainly in the \"bridge model\". Moreover, 0.2 mol L-1 HCl solution was considered as the most appropriate eluent for regeneration. It showed a great performance in the experiments for practical copper wastewater and the process was considerably cost-effective.","4679":"Rechargeable ion batteries have contributed immensely to shaping the modern world and been seriously considered for the efficient storage and utilization of intermittent renewable energies. To fulfill their potential in the future market, superior battery performance of high capacity, great rate capability, and long lifespan is undoubtedly required. In the past decade, along with discovering new electrode materials, the focus has been shifting more and more toward rational electrode designs because the performance is intimately connected to the electrode architectures, particularly their designs at the nanoscale that can alleviate the reliance on the materials' intrinsic nature. The utilization of nanoarchitectured arrays in the design of electrodes has been proven to significantly improve the battery performance. A comprehensive summary of the structural features and fabrications of the nanoarchitectured array electrodes is provided, and some of the latest achievements in the area of both lithium- and sodium-ion batteries are highlighted. Finally, future challenges and opportunities that would allow further development of such advanced electrode configuration are discussed.","3033":"Porous NiO flakes are synthesized using rice starch composed of amylose and amylopectin polysaccharide incorporated porous network as fuel by combustion synthesis and characterized through XRD, SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, EDAX, TGA, FT-IR and XPS analytical methods. The performance of NiO flakes as an anode in Li-ion cells is examined. NiO anode exhibits a stable specific capacity of 193 mAh g(-1) even after 120 cycles and the stability of formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is authenticated by virtue of negligible capacity fading at higher current rate as confirmed from ex-situ analysis of cycled electrodes.

Combined with micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology, it is important to develop a novel immune microelectrode array (MEA) not only for rapid analysis of serum samples, but also for cell detection in vitro and in vivo. In this work, we depict a simple approach to modify chitosan-multi-walled carbon nanotubes-thionine (CS-MWCNTs-THI) hybrid film through one-step electrochemical deposition and the CS-MWCNTs-THI hybrid films are successfully employed to immobilize anti-CEA for fabricating simple, label-free, and highly sensitive electro-chemical immune MEAs. The detection principle of immune MEA was based on the fact that the increasing formation of the antigen-antibody immunocomplex resulted in the decreased response currents and the relationship between the current reductions with the corresponding CEA concentrations was directly proportional. Experimental results indicated that the label-free MEA had good selectivity and the limit of detection for CEA is 0.5 pg\/mL signal to noise ratio (SNR) = 3. A linear calibration plot for the detection of CEA was obtained in a wide concentration range from 1 pg\/mL to 100 ng\/mL (r = 0.996). This novel MEA has potential applications for detecting CEA for the research on cancer cells and cancer tissue slices as well as for effective early diagnosis.","3245":"Metallic nanoparticles with different physical properties have been screen printed as authentication tags on different types of paper. Gold and silver nanoparticles show unique optical signatures, including sharp emission bandwidths and long lifetimes of the printed label, even under accelerated weathering conditions. Magnetic nanoparticles show distinct physical signals that depend on the size of the nanoparticle itself. They were also screen printed on different substrates and their magnetic signals read out using a magnetic pattern recognition sensor and a vibrating sample magnetometer. The novelty of our work lies in the demonstration that the combination of nanomaterials with optical and magnetic properties on the same printed support is possible, and the resulting combined signals can be used to obtain a user-configurable label, providing a high degree of security in anti-counterfeiting applications using simple commercially-available sensors.","1221":"Zeolites are potential adsorbents for dyes removal in wastewater; however, separation of the zeolite particles from the wastewater after adsorption is tedious. Structured zeolites in the form of fibers offer faster and easier adsorbent separation. Herein, we applied electrospinning (ES) technique to fabricate LTL zeolite fibers. To improve the mechanical stability of the zeolite fibers, aluminum chloride was added in the suspension prior to ES. Thermal analyses of the as-spun fibers suggest that calcination at 700 A degrees C is sufficient to decompose polymers and chloride ions. After calcination, the fibers contain (ca. 66 %) of LTL zeolite and (ca. 34 %) of alumina phases, while the diameter is below 1 A mu m. The alumina phase is very dense; the surface area of the fibers depends mainly on the zeolite content. Dyes sorption studies show that while the fibers exhibit significant adsorption toward cationic methylene blue (MB), it is ineffective for anionic orange G. The maximum MB adsorption capacity (Q (m)) for the zeolite fibers was found to be 30 mg g(-1) lower than bare zeolite powder (72 mg g(-1)). The fibers fibrous nature was retained to certain degree after sorption makes them easier and faster for separation and reuse.","1650":"Two L-phenylalanine derivatives with 5,8-bis(2-(carbazol-3-yl)vinyl)quinoxaline (PCQ) and 5,8-bis[2-(carbazol-3-yl)]-2,3-dimethylquinoxaline (DCQ) as fluorophores were synthesized, and their photophysical properties were measured and compared. The two compounds were found to gelate some organic solvents and self-assemble into 1D nanofibers in gels. The wet gel of PCQ emitted a weak orange fluorescence, but the DCQ gel had a strong green one. This result can be due to the presence of two methyl groups and the nonplanar conformation of fluorophore in DCQ. The gel film of DCQ also showed significantly stronger fluorescence than that of PCQ. Thus, the wet gel and xerogel film of DCQ were selected to study their sensing properties to acids. The yellow wet gel of DCQ transformed into a brown sol upon the addition of 0.2equiv trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), accompanied by emission quenching. The xerogel film of DCQ rapidly responded to volatile acids, such as TFA, HCl, and HOAc. The fluorescence of the xerogel film was gradually quenched with increased concentration of volatile acid vapors. The fibrous film exhibited low detection limits for volatile acid. The detection limits of the thin films for TFA, HCl, and HOAc reached 43, 122, and 950ppb, respectively.","6680":"ZnO crystallites were grown by electroless deposition on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fiber mats prepared by an electrospinning technique. The electroless deposition involves three steps: sensitization, activation and deposition, which were performed by subsequently dipping the PMMA fiber mats in the appropriate solutions. After the deposition the PMMA fibers are uniformly coated with ZnO prisms which show hexagonal wurtzite structure and optical signatures (band-gap value and emission bands) typical for this semiconductor. By combining electroless deposition and electrospinning, different semiconductor coated polymer fibers can be obtained for a wide range of applications. Both methods are appropriate for large scale production, being scalable, cheap, efficient and suitable for large-area covering techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used as reinforcement to increase the strength of the electrospun nylon 6 nanofibers. Young's modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of the nylon 6 non-woven fiber mats electrospun from 20 wt % solutions increased 51%, 87%, and 136%, respectively, after incorporating 1 wt % CNTs into the nylon 6 nanofibers. Three methods were investigated to enhance fiber-fiber load sharing: increasing friction between fibers, thermal bonding, and solvent bonding. The addition of beaded nylon 6 nanofibers into the non-woven fiber mats to increase fiber-fiber friction resulted in a statistically significantly increase in Young's modulus over comparable smooth non-woven fiber mats. After annealing, tensile strength, elongation, and toughness of the nylon 6 non-woven fiber mats electrospun from 20 wt % + 10 wt % solutions increased 26%, 28%, and 68% compared to those from 20 wt % solutions. Solvent bonding with formic acid vapor at room temperature for 30 min caused increases of 56%, 67%, and 39% in the Young's modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of non-woven fiber mats, respectively. The increases attributed to increased individual nanofiber strength and solvent bonding synergistically resulted in the improvement of Young's modulus of the electrospun nylon 6 non-woven fiber mats.","6676":"We show a simple and effective way in fabricating CdS nanoparticle-functionalized natural cotton cellulose electrospun nanofibers, via combining the electrospinning technique and the chemical bath deposition method. CdS nanoparticles, with cubic zinc-blende structure, can be dispersed uniformly on the surfaces of cotton cellulose nanoribers.

Despite enormous recent development in DNA nanotechnology, very little is known about DNA-membrane interactions at a molecular level. Here we employ biased atomic-scale computer simulations to calculate for the first time the free energy profile for partitioning a DNA molecule into a phospholipid bilayer, a system that is routinely used to mimic the properties of cell membranes. Our findings clearly show that a zwitterionic lipid bilayer represents a repulsive barrier for DNA: the potential of the mean force profile does not develop any local minima upon moving DNA from water into the lipid\/water interface. This energetic barrier can be overcome e.g. via adsorption of divalent calcium ions on the surface of a lipid bilayer, which makes the lipid bilayer effectively cationic. Indeed, our biased molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the corresponding free energy profile for partitioning DNA into a lipid bilayer with adsorbed Ca ions is characterized by a deep minimum. Therefore, the bilayer-bound calcium ions can serve as a trigger of the electrostatic attraction between DNA and zwitterionic phospholipids. In addition, we performed a series of unbiased computer simulations for lipid bilayers with absorbed calcium ions and showed that the initial DNA binding is driven by an overall positive charge of the bilayer, while DNA is stabilized on the bilayer surface by Ca ions that laterally diffuse towards DNA to form tight bridges between phosphate groups of DNA and lipids. Overall, our computational findings contribute to a long-standing problem of interactions of charged nano-objects (such as DNA and DNA-base nanostructures) with cell membranes.","828":"The chitosan-induced coacervation of milk proteins was investigated using a proteomic approach. The addition of 0.8% chitosan to milk caused the milk proteins to coacervate after a 1 h incubation period. Approximately 86% of the milk proteins were present in the milk pellet fraction (MPF), and the protein concentration of the milk supernatant fraction (MSF) decreased from 29.4 +\/- 0.2 to 4.2 +\/- 0.6 mg\/mL. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the total intensities of serum albumin (BSA), (S)-casein ((S)-CN), -casein (-CN), -casein (-CN) and -lactoglobulin (-LG) in the MSF decreased to 8.5% +\/- 0.2%, 0.9% +\/- 0.3%, 0.7% +\/- 0.3%, 0.5% +\/- 0.2% and 15.0% +\/- 0.5%, respectively. Two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis indicated that (S1)-, (S2)-, - and -CN and a fraction of the -LG and BSA were found in the MSF following incubation with 0.8% chitosan. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicated that binding of chitosan to milk proteins is an exothermic reaction based on binding titration curves of milk proteins dispersions with chitosan, and the enthalpy of binding (H) and binding constant (Ka) were -7.85 x 10(4) cal\/mol and 1.06 x 10(5)\/mol, respectively. These results suggested that the addition of 0.8% chitosan causes milk proteins to coacervate due to polysaccharide-protein interactions.","957":"H2S gas in the environment, even at a concentration as low as 20 ppb, is very harmful to the health of human beings. Therefore, the design and fabrication of sensors for detecting trace H2S gas in the environment are highly desirable. However, it remains a challenge to develop gas sensors that can detect H2S at ppb concentration levels and at a relatively low temperature. Herein we developed a facile method to fabricate porous two-dimensional net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures. Both the SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles were significantly smaller in the net-like heteronanostructures than in net-like SnO2 and ZnO homonanostructures. Heterojunctions formed at the interfaces between SnO2 and ZnO-and, as a result, the net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures-exhibited better H2S-sensing properties, including higher sensor response, better selectivity and long-term stability, than did the net-like SnO2 and ZnO homonanostructures, and other types of metal oxide-based nanocomposites. Importantly, the SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures could detect 10 ppb H2S even at a working temperature of 100 degrees C. Therefore, the net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures have very promising applications in high-performance H2S sensors. In addition, the fabrication method presented here is facile, repeatable and operable, and may thus be extended to synthesize other types of metal oxide-based heteronanostructures for applications in various fields.","4712":"Ambient pressure drying of polymethylsilsesquioxane gels via dynamic shrinkage-reexpansion has been investigated for preparation of aerogel-like xerogels and their application to thermal superinsulators. An extended aging of wet gels in aqueous solution containing precursor-derived species is found to be crucial in obtaining crack-free, monolithic xerogels with sufficiently low thermal conductivity (13.7 mW m(-1) K-1) at bulk density of 0.140 g cm(-3) (porosity similar to 90%).

The process was successfully used for the development of hybrid nanofiber scaffolds with improved surface hydrophilicity designed specifically for bone tissue regeneration (BTR). The results confirmed that the presence of PVA during the hydrothermal process stimulates the crystalline conformation of N6. Compared to the pristine N6 mat, pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells showed much better attachment. Our results suggest that the newly developed hybrid scaffolds could be very useful for promoting BTR.

The MMP9 promoter has a functional polymorphism rs3918242 that can regulate the level of gene transcription. This study recruited 200 AF patients and 240 controls. The MMP9 rs3918242 was examined by polymerase chain reactions. HL-1 atrial myocytes were cultured and electrically stimulated. Right atrial appendages were obtained from six patients with AF and three controls with sinus rhythm undergoing open heart surgery. The MMP9 expression and activity were determined using immunohistochemical analysis and gelatin zymography, respectively. Rapid pacing induces MMP9 secretion from HL-1 myocytes in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The responsiveness of MMP9 transcriptional activity to tachypacing was significantly enhanced by rs3918242. The expression of MMP9 was increased in fibrillating atrial tissue than in sinus rhythm. However, the distribution of rs3918242 genotypes and allele frequencies did not significantly differ between the control and AF groups. HL-1 myocyte may secrete MMP9 in response to rapid pacing, and the secretion could be modulated by rs3918242. Although the MMP9 expression of human atrial myocyte is associated with AF, our study did not support the association of susceptibility to AF among Taiwanese subjects with the MMP9 rs3918242 polymorphism.","1941":"A novel facile strategy was developed to prepare the Fe3O4@graphene aerogel (Fe3O4@GA) composites. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed into the 3D network of graphene aerogel and the resultant hybrid composites contained meso-and macro-scale pores with high specific surface area (276.9 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (0.3230 cm(3) g(-1)). The electrochemical performance revealed that the Fe3O4@GA anode exhibited high reversible capacity (941.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1)), stable cycling performance, and excellent rate capability.

An optimal loading of ethyl cellulose additive in a precursor solution was found to be essential for the morphology control and thus its electrocatalytic activity.

This study provides a possible strategy, solvent-free e-spinning to solve this problem. By using a modified homemade e-spinning device and UV curable materials as the precursor liquid, all the spinning solution was successfully e-spun into ultrathin fibers without solvent evaporation (weight loss) in an atmosphere of nitrogen and under UV light radiation. The solidification mechanism of the fibers is ascribed to the quick curing of the acrylate bonds in the spinning stream under UV light radiation and without oxygen inhibition in the atmosphere of nitrogen. Such a break-through leads to fabrication of ultrathin fibers by solvent-free e-spinning without solution loss, and provides an ecofriendly approach to prepare new and functional (composite) ultrathin fibers by using a variety of UV curable materials and functional additions.","6174":"Textile industry is among the highly polluting industries in water effluent. It consumes large quantities of water and chemicals compounds. These releases can have varying characteristics regarding their volumes and pollutants concentrations. Therefore, adverse effects can be observed as consequence on environment and biodiversity. According to the environmental protection regulations in Morocco, the treatment of this water before discharge is compulsorily to avoid pollution of surface and ground water. The aim of our study is the treatment of these effluents by a physicochemical process using coagulation \/ locculation. Two coagulants of different type and purity are used. The first one \"aluminum sulfate\" is a pure coagulants used on industrial scale. The second \"alum stone\" is excerpt from the nature of Moroccan desert. Beside, two flocculants are compared, a natural extract from cactus and a polymer synthesized (polyacrylamide). The comparative study between a pure coagulant and a biocoagulant, with the two flocculants, showed a very good absorbency rate of reduction (ABS), turbidity (T), chemical oxygen demand (DCO), dry matter (DM) and chemical elements (sodium, lithium, nitrogen, phosphorus, boron, and silicon). By the jar test treatment process, the optimal dose of coagulants and flocculants to use in the neutral pH treatment was identified. The optimal dose used gives 85% of abatement efficiency absorbance, 90 % for turbidity and 80% for the chemical oxygen demand. Moreover, the dry matter content is over 25% and over 90% for some chemical elements.","308":"Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water soluble synthetic polymer, with a backbone composed only of carbon atoms and is biodegradable under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This polymer can be prepared by the hydrolysis of polyvinylacetate and is one of the most important synthetic polymers used in commercial, industrial, medical and nutraceutical applications. The environmental issues caused by PVA industrial practice have increased globally. Several methods have been used to treat PVA industrial discharge including in particular physicochemical methods such as electrocoagulation. Nowadays, use of bioremediation for PVA release, which has caused serious pollution problems in the natural environment, has attracted much interest. The bioremediation ability of microorganisms and their PVA degrading enzymes, especially PVA oxidases\/hydrolases, has long been perceived. These enzymes as well as symbiotic microorganisms could be an effective means for biodegradation of PVA.","5095":"A new low cost and highly reproducible technique is presented that provides patterned cell culture substrates. These allow for selective positioning of cells and a chemically and mechanically directed guiding of their extensions. The patterned substrates consist of structured agarose hydrogels molded from reusable silicon micro templates. These templates consist of pins arranged equidistantly in squares, connected by bars, which mold corresponding wells and channels in the nonadhesive agarose hydrogel. Subsequent slice production with a standard vibratome, comprising the described template pattern, completes substrate production. Invertebrate neurons of locusts and pond snails are used for this application as they offer the advantage over vertebrate cells as being very large and suitable for cultivation in low cell density. Their neurons adhere to and grow only on the adhesive areas not covered by the agarose. Agarose slices of 50 ism thickness placed on glass, polystyrene, or MEA surfaces position and immobilize the neurons in the wells, and the channels guide their neurite outgrowth toward neighboring wells. In addition to the application with invertebrate neurons, the technique may also provide the potential for the application of a wide range of cell types. Long-term objective is the achievement of isolated low-density neuronal networks on MEAs or different culture substrates for various network analysis applications.","2288":"Using direct focused ion beam milling lithography, we show fabrication of plasmonic nanoantennae with ultrasmall inter-particle separations and different outlines. Ultrasmall gap widths are achieved by appropriately aligning coaxial apertures during the milling process. The absorbance of the fabricated nanoantennae is experimentally characterized. As an important application, surface enhanced Raman scattering is demonstrated since such densely packed plasmonic nanoantennae with ultrasmall gaps can enable strong field enhancement, leading to important potential in nanophotonics and integrated optics.","6884":"Biodegradable oxide synaptic transistors were fabricated on a graphene coated PET substrate. An acid doped chitosan-based biopolymer electrolyte is used as the gate dielectric. With the acid doping, a high proton conductivity of similar to 7.6 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and a big electric-double-layer capacitance of similar to 1.0 mu F cm(-2) are observed for the biopolymer electrolyte. The fabricated oxide synaptic transistor exhibits good transistor performances, such as a low operation voltage of 1.0 V, a high field-effect mobility of similar to 5.4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), a high on\/off ratio of similar to 3.1 x 10(6) and a low subthreshold swing of similar to 80 mV decade(-1). With the unique proton gating behaviors, synaptic functions, such as excitatory post-synaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation and synaptic filtering were mimicked. Furthermore, the proposed oxide synaptic transistor could be dissolved in water in a short time. We believe that the proposed biodegradable synaptic transistors could provide new opportunities for low cost, portable \"green'' neuromorphic electronics.","3601":"Magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the wood surface via a hydrothermal process at 70 degrees C. The surface of the as-prepared magnetic NiFe2O4\/wood hybrids (MWHs) was covered by spherical-like NiFe2O4 particles with an average size of 50 nm. MWH exhibited the thermostability, microwave absorbability, and superparamagnetism with saturation magnetization (M-s) of 1.79 emu.g(-1). With further modification by 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane (FAS-17), MWH expressed superhydrophobic performances with a water contact angle of 158 degrees.

NFC films were made for reference. The succinic ester of GGM was synthesised at low (GGM-Su1) and high (GGM-Su2) degree of substitution to obtain different level of water repellence. GGM and its succinic esters had good affinity with NFC substrate. This made it possible to implement the barrier functionality on the NFC network with the adequate mechanical properties. The coatings further enhanced the already excellent oxygen permeability properties, achieving 0.1 [(cm(3) A mu m)(m(2) kPa d)] as the lowest value with the NFC-GGM film double-coated with GGM-Su2. The films demonstrated pronounced stiffness by adding GGM to the NFC, as well as coating of GGM-Su2 on the NFC-GGM films at 0-90 % relative humidity. The films turned out to be impenetrable with grease even at high temperatures. NFC-GGM film with GGM-Su2 coating exhibited hydrophobic characteristics according to the water contact angle measurements. It was shown that adding 5.5 wt% of GGM to a NFC film and further 5.4 wt% of coating of GGM-Su or GGM on the film may highly enhance the feasibility of the biocomposites to be used for food packaging to replace typical oil-based non-biodegradable plastics currently used.","3739":"The incorporation of functionalised carbon nanodots within a novel low molecular weight salt hydrogel derived from 5-aminosalicylic acid is reported.

In addition, research toward achieving an efficient catalyst supporting matrix has also attracted much attention in recent years. Carbon black- (Vulcan XC-72) supported Platinum and Platinum-Ruthenium catalysts have for long served as the conventional choice as the cathode and the anode catalyst materials, respectively. Oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode and methanol oxidation reaction at the anode occur simultaneously during the operation of a direct methanol fuel cell. However, inefficiencies in these reactions result in a generation of mixed potential. This, in turn, gives rise to reduced cell voltage, increased oxygen stoichiometric ratio, and generation of additional water that is responsible for water flooding in the cathode chamber. In addition, the lack of long-term stability of Pt-Ru anode catalyst, coupled with the tendency of Ru to cross through the polymer electrolyte membrane and eventually get deposited on the cathode, is also a serious drawback. Another source of potential concern is the fact that the natural resource of Pt and the rare earth metal Ru is very limited, and has been predicted to become exhausted very soon. To overcome these problems, new catalyst systems with high methanol tolerance and higher catalytic activity than Pt need to be developed. In addition, the catalyst-supporting matrix is also witnessing a change from traditionally used carbon powder to transition metal carbides and other high-performance materials. This article surveys the recent literature based on the advancements made in the field of highly dispersible inorganic catalysts for application in direct methanol fuel cells, as well as the progress made in the area of catalyst-supporting matrices.","2926":"Excimer laser at 193 nm was irradiated on the renal tissues during various exposure times in order to investigate the chemical and physical surface properties using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, photo electron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and tensile test accordingly.

Nevertheless, there is still a major challenge on how to modulate the nanostructure of graphene architectures to further enhance the electrochemical performance. Herein, self-closure graphene aerogels with inbuilt baffle plates (SGA) were prepared by a combined strategy involving electrostatic assembly, hydrothermal fixing, polydopamine (PDA) coating, and annealing. The electrostatic assembly between graphene oxide (GO) and polystyrene sphere@polydopamine (PS@PDA) is the key factor to form the self-closure aerogels and the graphene sheets wrapped onto the PS@PDAs are responsible for the formation of the baffle plates. When employed as the host material for Li-S batteries, the as-made SGA can contribute to promotion of the transport of electrons, increasing the sulfur loading, confining the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides, and accommodating the volume expansion. As a result, the as-made SGA-sulfur composite can deliver an outstanding cycling stability of 509 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1C. The present work will provide a simple and effective approach to tuning the assembly of graphene and further configuring the tailor-made host materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.","3470":"The regenerative H-2\/Br-2-HBr fuel cell, utilizing an oxidant solution of Br(2)in aqueous HBr, shows a number of benefits for grid-scale electricity storage. The membrane-electrode assembly, a key component of a fuel cell, contains a proton-conducting membrane, typically based on the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer. Unfortunately, the high cost of PFSA membranes and their relatively high bromine crossover are serious drawbacks. Nanofiber composite membranes can overcome these limitations. In this work, composite membranes were prepared from electrospun dual-fiber mats containing Nafion((R)) PFSA ionomer for facile proton transport and an uncharged polymer, polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), for mechanical reinforcement, and swelling control. After electrospinning, Nafion\/PPSU mats were converted into composite membranes by softening the PPSU fibers, through exposure to chloroform vapor, thus filling the voids between ionomer nanofibers. It was demonstrated that the relative membrane selectivity, referenced to Nafion((R)) 115, increased with increasing PPSU content, e.g., a selectivity of 11 at 25 vol% of Nafion fibers. H-2-Br(2)fuel cell power output with a 65 m thick membrane containing 55 vol% Nafion fibers was somewhat better than that of a 150 m Nafion((R)) 115 reference, but its cost advantage due to a four-fold decrease in PFSA content and a lower bromine species crossover make it an attractive candidate for use in H-2\/Br-2-HBr systems.","2921":"A novel three-dimensional (3D) Fe2O3\/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hydrogel (FGH) is prepared by a facile hydrothermal strategy. In this composite hydrogel, RGO sheets self-assemble into an interconnected macroporous framework and Fe2O3 nanotubes encapsulate into RGO layers. The FGH delivers high rate capacities of 850, 780, 550, and 400 mAh\/g at current densities of 200, 400, 600, and 800 mA\/g, respectively. The specific capacity can still maintain at similar to 600 mAh\/g after 70 cycles, which greatly outperforms that of pure Fe2O3 nanotubes (similar to 60 mAh\/g after 70 cycles). The improved electrochemical performance is ascribed to the unique macroscopic structure which is beneficial for enlarging the active surface area, shortening the electron\/ion pathway, accommodating the volume change of Fe2O3 nanotubes, and preventing the aggregation of both Fe2O3 nanoparticles and RGO sheets.

Using aqueous polyoxometalate (POM) as a catalyst at the anode, the raw biomass is oxidized and electrons are transferred to POM molecules by heating or light-irradiation. Protons from biomass diffuse to the cathode and are reduced to hydrogen. The electric energy consumption could be as low as 0.69 kW h per normal cubic meter of H-2 (Nm(-3) H-2) at 0.2 A cm(-2), which is only 16.7% of the energy consumed for the reported water electrolysis. Unlike the traditional electrolysis of alcohols, a noble-metal catalyst is not required at the anode.","1199":"High frequency applications of magnetic nanoparticles, such as therapeutic hyperthermia and magnetic particle imaging, are sensitive to nanoparticle size and dipole moment. Usually, it is assumed that magnetic nanoparticles with a log-normal distribution of the physical size also have a log-normal distribution of the magnetic dipole moment. Here, we test this assumption for different types of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the 5-20 nm range, by multimodal fitting of magnetization curves using the MINORIM inversion method. The particles are studied while in dilute colloidal dispersion in a liquid, thereby preventing hysteresis and diminishing the effects of magnetic anisotropy on the interpretation of the magnetization curves. For two different types of well crystallized particles, the magnetic distribution is indeed log-normal, as expected from the physical size distribution. However, two other types of particles, with twinning defects or inhomogeneous oxide phases, are found to have a bimodal magnetic distribution. Our qualitative explanation is that relatively low fields are sufficient to begin aligning the particles in the liquid on the basis of their net dipole moment, whereas higher fields are required to align the smaller domains or less magnetic phases inside the particles.

The morphology, crystal structure, optical and photocurrent responses, as well as the photocatalytic performance of the obtained photocatalysts were characterized and investigated in detail. The results suggest that the modified TiO2 porous nanofibers show significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity, as Bi nanoparticles would largely extend the visible light absorption of TiO2 because of its surface plasmon resonance. The co-existence of the semiconductor behavior of Bi nanoparticles could further prevent the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with holes. Overall, this work provides new insights into the fabrication of TiO2 based composites as high performance photocatalysts, facilitating their application in the environmental protection issues.

In this study, the synthesis of RuNi bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) supported on carbon black catalysts (denoted as RuNi BNSC) via hydrazine hydrate reduction and galvanic replacement reaction methods was reported. Then the effect of the annealing temperature in N-2 (uncalcined, 160, 230, 280, 380, 480, 580 and 680 degrees C) of RuNi BNSC on its catalytic activity for the benzene hydrogenation reaction was investigated. It was found that RuNi BNSC calcined at 380 degrees C exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in the liquid phase hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane, which was about 3-4 times higher than that of RuNi BNSC calcined at 680 degrees C, while RuNi BNSC annealed at 480 degrees C had no activity for this reaction. The characterization results of the catalysts indicated that various thermal treatment temperatures in N-2 affected the RuNi BNP size, chemical states of Ru and Ni, and RuNi bimetallic nanostructures and thus the catalytic properties.","7077":"Controllable integration of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and a carbonaceous material is a promising strategy to obtain cost-effective and highly efficient nano-catalysts. Three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based aerogel is considered as an ideal catalyst support because it not only possesses the superior properties of graphene, but also can provide a high loading volume with hierarchical 3D porous architectures. In this paper, PtNP-decorated 3D nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel was prepared through a one-pot hydrothermal route for the first time. Compared to PtNP-decorated 3D graphene aerogel or PtNP-decorated 2D graphene, this nanocomposite shows excellent electrocatalytic activity because of the nitrogen doping and 3D porous structure.","6597":"In view of the high content of the highly stable anthocyanin in red radish roots, the plant is considered as a potent source of natural anthocyanins. However, the presence of off flavor in their anthocyanin extracts is the only limitation as far as their application in food and pharmaceutical industries is concerned. The aim of this work was to develop a suitable method for extracting the off flavor free red radish root anthocyanin, while conserving high anthocyanin yield. Results showed that phosphoric and citric acidified hexane (pH 2.5) extracts yielded maximum anthocyanin levels of 208.37 mg\/100 g and 202.89 mg\/100 g fresh radish, respectively with lower percentage polymeric color and higher color density, chroma and hue angle compared to other extracts at different pH values. Tentative anthocyanin identification by UPLC-TQ-MS showed 12 glycosylated anthocyanins substituted at C3 and C5 in phosphoric acidified extracts and only 10 in citric acidified extracts. In addition, analysis of total glucosinolates (GSLs) revealed significant inhibition of glucosinolate degradation in acidified hexane extracts (pH 2.5) compared to the other extracts. The off flavor evaluated by GC-MS revealed a significant decrease of isothiocyanates, sulfides and nitrogen containing compounds in acidified hexane (pH 2.5) compared to other extracts. Furthermore, dehydration and rehydration of extracts showed that over 70% of off flavor compounds could be removed in two phases (aqueous and hexane) during hexane removal. Results of sensory evaluation confirmed that the red radish root anthocyanin from the phosphoric acidified hexane (pH 2.5) was closer to the color and odor characteristics of the commercial red radish anthocyanin. Therefore, the phosphoric acidified hexane method could be a suitable method to extract off flavor free anthocyanin from red radish roots.","1407":"Solid-oxide fuel cells are promising devices for sustainable power generation. Electrolyte materials play an important role in connecting the anode and cathode, and they influence the performance of the device. In this context, gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) has proven to be an efficient electrolyte material, although the presence of dopant clusters can lower its efficiency. After usage, dopant clusters start appearing at dislocations, translocations, grain boundaries, or surfaces. Hence, the study of dopant clustering at the atomic level near these regions becomes of vital importance, as it allows us to understand the reasons for the occurrence of this phenomenon and its impact on the oxygen conduction. In this context, the present paper studies the impact of dopant clustering near the (111) GDC surface. We have studied two different gadolinium concentrations in the material, of approximately 7% and 14%, which are close to the optimum concentration of 10%. Our results indicate that surface relaxation is a key factor in determining the preference of defect clusters to be found in the surface. We have also calculated the relative abundance of different defect clusters at different temperatures, including the configurational entropy term. It was revealed that working temperatures (650-1100 K) show the relative abundance of different cluster structures, displaying that, at high concentrations, preferred dopant clusters resemble the structure of Gd2O3, showing the formation of gadolinia domains. Finally, we show that oxygen diffusion will be affected by the formation of these domains. After evaluating the oxygen mobility, we conclude that oxygen vacancies will be trapped by the gadolinium clusters at the surface. These vacancy traps prevent oxygen diffusion, thereby affecting negatively the performance of the material and the fuel cell in general.","1315":"In developing high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, building kinetically stable graphene-SnO2 anode is appealing yet remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a balanced design of graphene-SnO2 composite, i.e., a flexible nitrogen-doped graphene\/SnO2 (NG-SnO2) foam with an integrated macroscale film and interconnected micro-\/nano-foam architecture. The combined favorable structure and components improve the Li+ accessibility and electron transmission, while prevent side reactions with the electrolyte and SnO2. Notably, a novel electrochemistry is triggered by the synergistic effect between SnO2 and graphene, i.e., irreversible conversion reaction of SnO2 becomes reversible upon cycling. These efforts lead to an ascending capacity with the increment of >1000 mA h g(-1). The composite foam can retain more than 81% of its initial capacity to 1678 mA h g(-1) over cycles of 8.5 months at a rate of 0.1 A g(-1), exhibiting kinetically-stable electrochemical performances.

Among the most promising metal free ORR electrocatalysts, nitrogen-doped carbon materials have generated significant research interest. Nitrogen doping within a graphitic\/turbostratic network of carbon atoms generates active sites for the ORR via C-N bond polarisation that induces a reduced energy barrier towards the ORR on the adjacent carbon atom. At the same time, nitrogen doping leads to an increased electrical conductivity due to electron excess in the delocalised p-system. Thus, the electrical conductivity and the number and the nature of the active sites are two important factors determining the performance of nitrogen-doped carbons in the ORR. Herein, N-doped nanocarbon\/graphene composites were carefully designed, synthesized, characterized and tested as electrocatalysts in the ORR in order to decouple these two factors and investigate the underlying relationships between them. Chitosan was used as a nitrogen precursor for nanocarbon, while reduced graphene oxide was introduced to tune the electrical conductivity. Our results show that a low conductivity limits the exertion of active sites and results in a conductivity-dependent ORR activity. However, when the conductivity reaches a critical value, the active sites can be fully utilized and contribute to a positively correlated ORR activity.","6525":"Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes with sodium alginate (SA) as the \"fouled surface\" were prepared, in an effort to control irreversible membrane fouling in mimetic sewage treatment processes. The anchored SA layer improved the wetting ability of the PVDF membrane surface and used as a functional antifouling coating to improve the antifouling ability towards organic pollutants. The modified membrane (S-T-0.3) exhibited excellent fouling resistance, with the irreversible fouling ratio (IFR) values of 9%, 1%, 8% and 6% for the pollutant solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA), SA, humic acid (HA) and mimetic sewage, respectively; while the IFR values of the neat PVDF membrane for all the pollutant solutions were higher than 30%. The fouled surface of the PVDF membrane suppressed the adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants due to the improved hydrophilicity, and prevented hydrophilic pollutants from entering the membrane pores due to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and counterion effects. The higher water flux recovery ratios were observed because the pollutants were withheld on the modified membrane surface due to the cake layer feature of SA, and could be eliminated by simple flushing, leading to less irreversible fouling. The purpose of this article is to provide a novel and effective antifouling mechanism for the solution of the membrane fouling problem in sewage treatment.","2942":"The use of renewable resources to make various synthetic materials is increasing in order to meet some of our sustainability challenges. Yeast is one of the most common household ingredients, which is cheap and easy to reproduce. Herein we report that yeast cells can be thermally transformed into hollow, core-shell heteroatom-doped carbon microparticles that can effectively electrocatalyze the oxygen reduction and hydrazine oxidation reactions, reactions that are highly pertinent to fuel cells or renewable energy applications. We also show that yeast cell walls, which can easily be separated from the cells, can produce carbon materials with electrocatalytic activity for both reactions, albeit with lower activity compared with the ones obtained from intact yeast cells. The results reveal that the intracellular components of the yeast cells such as proteins, phospholipids, DNAs and RNAs are indirectly responsible for the latter's higher electrocatalytic activity, by providing it with more heteroatom dopants. The synthetic method we report here can serve as a general route for the synthesis of (electro)catalysts using microorganisms as raw materials.","6020":"Two samples of fibrous erionite from different localities of Oregon, USA were suspended in FeCl2 solutions at different concentrations, at pH ca. 5, in anaerobic conditions. Comparison between released and acquired charges under the form of Fe confirms that erionite binds Fe (II) by ion exchange with the extra framework (EF) cations, mainly Na. The Fe (II) binding process exhibited by both studied samples here investigated indicates a direct correlation between the extent of the ion-exchange process and the Fe (II) concentration of the solution used for fibres incubation. In the sample from Rome no further Fe (II) acquisition was observed for concentrations exceeding 500 mu M FeCl2. XPS investigation revealed that, when comparing surface and bulk composition of the samples, no Fe enrichment of the fibre surface was observed. Moreover, the location of Fe (II) within the erionite cage has been devised by combining chemical and structural data. Results highlight that, for both samples, Fe (II) is fixed at the Ca3 site being six-fold coordinated to water molecules. The occurrence of Fe (II) within the erionite cage causes a gradual migration of the other EF cations and in addition, induces a small rearrangement of the water molecules positions. It is worth mentioning that, in Fe-loaded zeolites at rather low Fe content, the Fe sites with very low nuclearity, located in well-defined crystallographic positions, represent the active sites for the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, identification of segregation of Fe (II) at Ca3, which is coupled with the high surface area of erionite, provides very important information for the understanding of the molecular mechanism\/s inducing its strong carcinogenicity.

In this advance, herein, we report a liquid crystal (LC) based simple, robust experimental design for rapid and precise recognition of the interaction of LPS with PG and LTA. The optical appearance of nematic 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) LCs changed from dark to bright (consistent with an ordering transition of the LCs) in contact with an aqueous solution of PG and LTA on LPS-laden aqueous-LC interfaces. The ordering transition demonstrates the strong interaction between PG and LTA with LPS at these interfaces. Our experiment also revealed that the interaction of PG and LTA towards LPS is highly specific. In addition, PG and LTA shows different binding affinity towards LPS and response of the LC is found to vary significantly from one to another which is conveniently quantified by measurement of the light intensity transmitted through the LC under crossed polars. Langmuir Blodgett (LB) and polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) measurements provide further insight on LPS laden aqueous-LC interfaces. Finally, we have also quantified the different binding affinity of PG and LTA towards LPS by measuring the optical retardance of the LC at aqueous-LC interfaces. Overall, the results presented in this paper offer a promising approach to study and quantify the interactions between different bacterial cell membrane components with LPS at aqueous-LC interfaces.","3491":"Three-dimensionally macroporous, Si and N-incorporated graphene aerogels (3D SN-rGOAs) are successfully fabricated through a self-assembly, vapor deposition of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), and thermal treatment for gas adsorption applications. As investigated by spectroscopic methods, the interaction between oxygen-containing groups of GO and APTES results in the uniform incorporation of Si and N atoms on the surface of 3D SN-rGOAs. The resulting SN-rGOAs are composed of the 3D interconnected macroporous structures with the mesoporosity by means of the reorganization of rGO sheets. The existence and distribution of Si and N atoms are characterized and their atomic compositions are 6.19 and 4.24%, respectively. Even after the incorporation of Si and N atoms, the surface area and pore volume of SN-rGOAs are slightly larger than those of pristine rGOAs due to thermal treatment at 900 degrees C, which also promotes the further restoration of sp(2) conjugation. The as-obtained SN-rGOAs show a dramatic improvement in the adsorption capacities and kinetics of CO2 and SO2 because of the existences of Si and N atoms and 3D macroporous continuity.","5174":"Nanofibres prepared by electrospinning have shown enormous potential for various applications. They are obtained predominantly in the form of nonwoven fibre webs. The 2-dimensional nonwoven feature and fragility have considerably confined their further processing into fabrics through knitting or weaving. Nanofibre yarns, which are nanofibre bundles with continuous length and a twist feature, show improved tensile strength, offering opportunities for making 3-dimensional fibrous materials with precisely controlled fibrous architecture, porous features and fabric dimensions. Despite a few techniques having been developed for electrospinning nanofibre yarns, they are chiefly based on the needle electrospinning technique, which often has low nanofibre productivity. In this study, we for the first time report a nanofibre yarn electrospinning technique which combines both needle and needleless electrospinning. A rotating intermediate ring collector was employed to directly collect freshly-electrospun nanofibres into a fibrous cone, which was further drawn and twisted into a nanofibre yarn. This novel system was able to produce high tenacity yarn (tensile strength 128.9 MPa and max strain 222.1%) at a production rate of 240 m h(-1), with a twist level up to 4700 twists per metre. The effects of various parameters, e. g. position of the electrospinning units, operating conditions and polymer concentration, on nanofibre and yarn production were examined.","3745":"Functional porous nanoparticles have been considered as potential adsorbents for chromium (Cr) removal due to their unique properties such as high surface area, nanosized structure and specific affinity for heavy metal ions. Among these adsorbents, magnetic supports are one of the most efficient adsorbents for their unique advantages of easy separation under external magnetic fields. In this study, magnetic mesoporous melamine-formaldehyde (MMMF) nanoparticles with high surface area (393 m(2) g(-1)), uniform pore sizes (6.9 nm), and relatively high saturation magnetization (4.3 emu per g) have been prepared. These MMMF nanoparticles are highly effective in removing toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from water within 5 to 10 min. More importantly, they can be easily regenerated by a simple basic treatment (0.1 M NaOH) and reused at least five times. The effects of initial Cr(VI) concentration, temperature and pH on the adsorption properties of MMMF are also investigated. The superior adsorption properties of MMMF make them an attractive adsorbent for water quality purification and improvement.","4031":"Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality around the globe, despite the various advancements in science. The success of cancer treatment lies with early diagnosis and effective therapy making them inseparable. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary development in the field of nanomedicine with the development of new nanoparticles for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. These studies are generally focused on creating novel nanocomposites for combating cancer. This review will serve as a one-stop arrangement for collating and providing future perspectives about the various nanocomposite based in vitro and in vivo investigations for cancer diagnosis and treatment. From our study, it is revealed that nanocomposite based diagnosis engrosses nanosensors for detection and conjugation of biomarkers, quantum dots, radiolabeling, delivery of contrast agent for better imaging of cancer development. In cancer therapeutics, nanocomposites hold enormous potential in maximizing the benefits of both targeted chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. This review will encourage the need for in-depth molecular level examinations in relation to the cytotoxicity and bio-distribution of the developed nanocomposite should be evaluated in the clinical setting for better understanding. These supplementary studies on nanooncology would help in personalizing cancer theranostics making nanooncology a future trend.","1488":"Romanian acrylic fibers (PAN) were functionalized with substances that have different basicities: NaOH (pk(b=) 0.2), Chitosan (CS with pK(b) = 7.8) and hydroxyl amine (HA with pK(b) = 8.02). All the chemical changes that occur on the acrylic support during functionaliazation were evaluated with FTIR analysis and colorimetric method. Dyeings with non-specific dyes (acid dyes) using different concentrations, durations, and pHs were performed. The influence exerted on the K I S values was studied function of the reagents type used in functionalization. Comparing the tinctorial behaviors of the acrylic functionalized substrates were deducted the ideas as HA and HA+NaOH cause the chemical changes that most favor the dyeing with acid dyes. Durability of the functionalization effects has been demonstrated by good values for the resistances to wet treatments. The color differences (Delta E*, AL*, Delta a* Delta b*, Delta C* and Delta H*) indicate that any functionalized PAN sample is dyed more intensely than the witness, having brightness smaller and shades slightly different than of the witness.","503":"A multifunctional coating composed of polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMGP) and potassium alginate-carbon nanotubes (PA-CNTs) was constructed on cotton fabric via a layer-by-layer assembly technique. The growth of the assembly coating was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the result shows the assembly coating grows approximately linearly with the increase of bilayer number. The electrical conductivity test shows that the assembly coating endows cotton with electrical conductivity, due to the formation of a CNT network on the cotton fabric. The thermo-stability and flame resistance were evaluated by thermo-gravimetric analysis and a vertical flammability test, and the results indicate that the assembly coating promotes char formation, decreases the burning time and eliminates the afterglow during combustion. The antimicrobial assessment suggests that the assembly coating can effectively inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, and the inhibiting effect increases with the growth of bilayer number. A multifunctional cotton fabric could be produced by the LBL assembly technique, which enlarges its application area.","1374":"Low-cost, one-step, and hydrothermal synthesized 3D reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (RGOH) is exploited to fabricate a high performance NO2 and NH3 sensor with an integrated microheater. The sensor can experimentally detect NO2 and NH3 at low concentrations of 200 ppb and 20 ppm, respectively, at room temperature. In addition to accelerating the signal recovery rate by elevating the local silicon substrate temperature, the microheater is exploited for the first time to improve the selectivity of NO2 sensing. Specifically, the sensor response from NH3 can be effectively suppressed by a locally increased temperature, while the sensitivity of detecting NO2 is not significantly affected. This leads to good discrimination between NO2 and NH3. This strategy paves a new avenue to improve the selectivity of gas sensing by using the microheater to raise substrate temperature.","3801":"Semiconductor nanostructures that can effectively serve as light-responsive photocatalysts have been of considerable interest over the past decade. This is because their use in light-induced photocatalysis can potentially address some of the most serious environmental and energy related concerns facing the world today. One important application is photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under solar radiation. It is regarded as a clean and sustainable approach to hydrogen fuel generation because it makes use of renewable resources (i.e., sunlight and water), does not involve fossil fuel consumption, and does not result in environmental pollution or greenhouse gas emission. Another notable application is the photocatalytic degradation of nonbiodegradable dyes, which offers an effective way of ridding industrial wastewater of toxic organic pollutants prior to its release into the environment. Metal oxide semiconductors (e.g., TiO2) are the most widely studied class of semiconductor photocatalysts. Their nanostructured forms have been reported to efficiently generate hydrogen from water and effectively degrade organic dyes under ultraviolet-light irradiation. However, the wide band gap characteristic of most metal oxides precludes absorption of light in the visible region, which makes up a considerable portion of the solar radiation spectrum. Meanwhile, nanostructures of cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors (e.g., CdS), with their relatively narrow band gap that can be easily adjusted through size control and alloying, have displayed immense potential as visible-light-responsive photocatalysts, but the intrinsic toxicity of cadmium poses potential risks to human health and the environment. In developing new nanostructured semiconductors for light-driven photocatalysis, it is important to choose a semiconducting material that has a high absorption coefficient over a wide spectral range and is safe for use in real-world settings. Among the most promising candidates are the multinary chalcogenide semiconductors (MCSs), which include the ternary I-III-VI2 semiconductors (e.g., AgGaS2, CuInS2, and CuInSe2) and the quaternary I-2-II-IV-VI4 semiconductors (e.g., Cu2ZnGeS4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Ag2ZnSnS4). These inorganic compounds consist of environmentally benign elemental components, exhibit excellent light-harvesting properties, and possess band gap energies that are well-suited for solar photon absorption. Moreover, the band structures of these materials can be conveniently modified through alloying to boost their ability to harvest visible photons. In this Account, we provide a summary of recent research on the use of ternary I-III-VI2 and quaternary I-2-II-IV-VI4 semiconductor nanostructures for light-induced photocatalytic applications, with focus on hydrogen production and organic dye degradation. We include a review of the solution-based methods that have been employed to prepare multinary chalcogenide semiconductor nanostructures of varying compositions, sizes, shapes, and crystal structures, which are factors that are known to have significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalysts. The enhancement of photocatalytic performance through creation of hybrid nanoscale architectures is also presented. Lastly, views on the current challenges and future directions are discussed in the concluding section.","222":"We report the synthesis of a TiO2 nanohybrid with a unique morphology consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles decorating the surface of TiO2 nanofibers, obtained by a simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying technique, and its electrochemical studies as efficient anodes for the Li-ion battery. The TiO2-fiber\/particle composite electrode exhibited a very high discharge capacity (190 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles, at C\/10), excellent rate capability with remarkable capacity retention of 77% of initial capacity at 5C rate, and good cyclic stability, compared to TiO2 nanofibers and nanoparticles. The capacitive contribution from these electrodes is studied in detail by using cyclic voltammetry measurements, and the results are correlated with the overall electrochemical performance of the electrodes. The exceptional electrochemical characteristics exhibited by the TiO2-fiber\/particle composite electrode, synthesized through a low-cost and scalable electrospinning technique, make it an ideal anode material for large-scale Li-ion battery applications.","5965":"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a growth factor that induces osteoblast differentiation and promotes bone regeneration, has been extensively investigated in bone tissue engineering. The peptides of bioactive domains; corresponding to residues 73-92 of BMP-2 become an alternative to reduce adverse side effects caused by the use of high doses of BMP-2 protein. In this study, BMP-2 peptide functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-pep) were synthesized by covalently grafting BMP-2 peptide on the surface of nanoparticles via an aminosilane linker, and dexamethasone (DEX) was then loaded into the channel of MSNs to construct nanoparticulate osteogenic delivery systems (DEX@MSNs-pep). The in vitro cell viability of MSNs-pep was tested with bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exposure to different particle concentrations, revealing that the functionalized MSNs had better cytocompatibility than their bare counterparts, and the cellular uptake efficiency of MSNs-pep was remarkably larger than that of bare MSNs. The in vitro results also show that the MSNs-pep promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in terms of the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, and expression of bone-related protein. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs can be further enhanced by incorporating of DEX into MSNs-pep. After intramuscular implantation in rats for 3 weeks, the computed tomography (CT) images and histological examination indicate that this nanoparticulate osteogenic delivery system induces effective osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration in vivo. Collectively, the BMP-2 peptide and DEX incorporated MSNs can act synergistically to enhance osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which have potential applications in bone tissue engineering.","5845":"The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of static magnetic field (SMF) on the osteogenic properties of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). In this study in seven days viability assay we examined the impact of SMF on cells proliferation rate, population doubling time, and ability to form single cell derived colonies. We have also examined cells' morphology, ultrastructure and osteogenic properties on the protein as well as mRNA level. We established a complex approach, which enabled us to obtain informal:ion about SMF and hASCs potential in the context of differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. We demonstrated that SMF enhances both viability and osteogenic properties of hASCs through higher proliferation factor and shorter population doubling Lime. We have also observed asymmetrically positioned nuclei and organelles after SMF exposition. With regards to osteogenic properties we observed increased levels of osteogenic markers i.e. osteopontin, osteocalcin and increased ability to form osteonodules with positive reaction to Alizarin Red dye. We have also shown that SMF besides enhancing osteogenic properties of hASCs, simultaneously decreases their ability to differentiate into adipogenic lineage. Our results clearly show a direct influence of SMF On the osteogenic potential of hASCs. These results provide key insights into the role of SMF on their cellular fate and properties.

These properties make these materials irreplaceable for application in all-optical LC devices. At the same time, the high sensitivity of the photo-orientation prevents the extension of this method to electro-optical elements such as LC displays and photonic devices. To stabilize LC alignment on dye films, several approaches have been developed which employ reactive mesogens (RMs) capable of photopolymerization. This article comprehensively describes the approach associated with the passivation of photoaligning films by thin layers of RMs. It is shown that continuous RM films with a thickness >= 5 nm provide highly uniform, thermally and photo-stable LC alignment. This approach also provides a VHR of more than 99%, RDC voltage less than 5 mV, and image sticking parameter about 1.002, which are the same as for rubbed polyimide films. Together with the low pre-tilt angle, high anchoring energy and ability of alignment patterning, this makes the proposed approach promising for application in a range of electro-optical devices, particularly those requiring active matrix driving and multi-domain alignment.","7267":"Biodiesel is a type of renewable fuel and a potential alternative for continuously consumed fossil resources. Currently, the method applied for biodiesel production is transesterification which is divided into non-catalyzed reaction, chemical-catalyzed reaction and enzymatic reaction. Enzymatic reaction is more advantageous than the other methods because of its mild reaction conditions, easy product recovery, no wastewater generation, no saponification and higher quality of products. The main component in this reaction is an enzyme called lipase which can catalyze wide variety of substrate including free fatty acids. Two other main raw materials for biodiesel synthesis are oil and acyl acceptor such as alcohol. Biodiesel catalyzed by enzyme is affected by many factors such as lipase specificity, lipase immobilization, oil composition and purity, oil to acyl acceptor molar ratio, acyl acceptors, temperature, and water content. Many methods have been tested to manipulate these factors and improve the enzymatic reaction for biodiesel production. These methods include combination of lipases, enzyme pretreatment, enzyme post treatment, methanol addition technique, use of solvent and silica gel, and reactor design. This paper will critically discuss the three major components of enzymatic production of biodiesel and the methods used to improve enzymatic reaction, as well as a review on its economic evaluation and industrial scale production.","6503":"Recently, we have developed a series of charge balanced polyampholyte (PA) physical hydrogels by random copolymerization in water, which show extraordinarily high toughness, self-healing ability and viscoelasticity. The excellent performance of PA hydrogels is ascribed to dynamic ionic bond formation through inter-and intra-chain interactions. The randomness results in ionic bonds of wide strength distribution, the strong bonds, which serve as permanent crosslinking, imparting the elasticity, while the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. In this work, we developed a simple physical method, called a pre-stretching method, to promote the performance of PA hydrogels. By imposing a pre-stretching on the sample in the as-prepared state, ion complexation during dialysis is prominently accelerated and the final performance is largely promoted. Further analysis suggests that the strong bond formation induced by pre-stretching is responsible for the change in final performance. Pre-stretching decreases the entropy of the system and increases the chain alignment, resulting in an increased possibility for strong bond formation.","3975":"Simultaneously achieving tunable electromagnetic parameters and strong absorption capacity in a single material is still a great challenge. Here, we present Nd doped BiFeO3 with electromagnetic matching, which exhibits tunable electromagnetic properties and high-performance microwave absorption. The experimental and calculated results demonstrate that Nd doping generates the ordered domain structure and changes the coupling states of electrons, which induce difficult polarization rotation and strong natural ferromagnetic resonance, leading to the decrease of dielectric loss and the increase of magnetic loss with increasing Nd concentration. The electromagnetic parameters are tuned from mismatching to matching, and the microwave absorption is improved. Bi0.8Nd0.2FeO3 exhibits a remarkable reflection loss (RL) of -42 dB and bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) which covers nearly three quarters of the X-band at a thickness from 1.9 to 2.1 mm. This work highlights the applications of BFO as a high-performance microwave absorber and opens up a promising feasible route to the development of microwave absorbers in imaging, healthcare, information safety and military fields.","1922":"Tissue-engineering scaffolds provide biological and structural supports for cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Fibrous scaffolds properly mimic the native extra cellular matrix (ECM) fibers which play an important role in development and regeneration of tissue and\/or organs. One way to achieve fibrous scaffold with tailored properties is incorporating suitable nanomaterials into the polymeric matrix. In this study, the uniform and bead free fibers of poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) composited with different layered double hydroxide (LDH) contents (ranging from 0.1 wt.% to 10 wt.%) were successfully fabricated by electrospinning technique. The LDHs are uniformly dispersed throughout the fibers, as confirmed by Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The morphology, degradation, mechanical behavior, porosity, hydrophilicity, and protein adsorption of samples were analyzed. Also, the biological effects of nanocomposites on attachment, viability, proliferation, and adipogenic differentiation of mouse adipose derived stem cells (mADSCs) were evaluated. The results showed that the addition of LDH reduced the average fiber diameter and improved the tensile strength and elongation at break values of the PCL scaffold while hydrophilicity and degradation rate were increased. The LDH-enriched electrospun PCL scaffolds had a remarkable influence on cell adhesion and proliferation. Also, a significant increase in adipogenic differentiation of mADSCs was seen. The PCL-LDH fibrous scaffolds with a high porosity (94%) showed great potential in application for soft tissue engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We describe the design and implementation of a microfluidic device that applies discrete levels of shear stress to cells plated on hydrogel-based substrates of physiologically-relevant stiffness. The setup allows for measurements of cell morphology and inflammatory response to the combined stimuli, and identifies mechanisms by which vascular stiffening leads to pathological responses to blood flow. We found that the magnitude of shear stress required to affect endothelial cell morphology and inflammatory response depended on substrate stiffness. Endothelial cells on 100 Pa substrates demonstrate a greater increase in cell area and cortical stiffness and decrease in NF-kappa B nuclear translocation in response to TNF-alpha treatment compared to controls than cells plated on 10 kPa substrates. The response of endothelial cells on soft substrates to shear stress depends on the presence of hyaluronan (HA). These results emphasize the importance of substrate stiffness on endothelial function, and elucidate a means by which vascular stiffening in aging and disease can impact the endothelium.","1575":"In the present study, 2D micro- and nanofibrous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were fabricated using the electrospinning technique. The thermal, microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated micro- and nanofibrous scaffolds were assessed using structural\/phase, elemental, morphological characterizations and micro-universal testing machines. Finally, scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue growth. In addition, the toxicity of PCL scaffold on hFFs cells was explored with Live\/Dead staining. The morphological characterization of PCL scaffolds showed highly aligned micro- and nanofibrous morphology with porosity reaches to 66% and uniform diameter ranges from 200 nm to 1.4 mu m depending on PCL concentration, solvent and applied voltage. The FTIR results indicated that the micro\/nanofibers are almost the same for bulk PCL. The DSC results confirmed the semi-crystalline nature of PCL with crystallinity and temperature melting of microfibrous scaffold higher than that of the nanofibrous ones. The Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the PCL micro- and nanofibers have a single stage thermal degradation with higher decomposition temperature of microfibrous PCL scaffolds compared to the nanofibrous one. The mechanical test results indicated that the microfibrous scaffolds have an acceptable mechanical behavior for cell culture technology. Finally, the cell culture results showed that the cells are not only attached to the scaffold but also integrated with it; the cells are imbedded into the PCL scaffold, which is the ultimate goal of using these kinds of materials for tissue engineering.","6505":"In biotechnological processes the intracellular level of nucleotides and nucleotide sugars have a direct impact on the post-translational modification (glycosylation) of the therapeutic protein products and on the exopolysaccharide pattern of the cells. Thus, they are precursors and also key components in the production of glycoproteins and glycolipids. All four nucleotides (at different phosphorylation stages) and their natural sugar derivatives on the actual conditions under which the cells are grown. Therefore, their simultaneous determination at different time points and different cell culture conditions in biotechnological samples is of interest in order to develop the optimal cell culture process. In our study capillary electrophoresis (CE) combined with UV detection @ 260 nm was selected for the separation and quantification of the complex nucleotide mixture of the structurally very similar nucleotides and nucleotide sugars in cell extracts. The high separation efficiency of CE as well as its insensitivity to the complex cell matrix makes this method superior to commonly used HPLC methods. In our study eleven nucleotides and six nucleotide sugars were analyzed. A robust and reproducible analysis system was developed. As background electrolyte borate (40 mM, pH 9.5) was used containing 1% PEG (MW 35'000 Da) which enhanced resolution. In order to obtain high reproducibility in terms of migration time, mandatory for the unambiguous identification of the single compounds in the complex cell extract mixtures, dynamic coating was also employed. The method was tested for CHO cell extracts where three sugar nucleotides and seven nucleotides were identified and quantified using GDP-Glc as internal standard.","6462":"Chromium removal is of significance to our daily life; however, the fabrication of high-performance sorbents with practicality remains a challenge. Herein, alginate-derived carbon beads (Alg-CB-X) with a developed nano-network were successfully prepared through a simple carbothermal reduction at different carbonization temperatures and acid treatment. The aim of this material was for easy separation and removal of Cr(VI) from water. The materials were characterized by FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, EDS, Raman spectrometry and N-2 sorption measurements. Parameters affecting the uptake of Cr(VI) ions by Alg-CB-X such as solution pH, initial concentration, contact time and coexisting anions were investigated systematically in batch experiments. The mechanism investigation showed that the removal of Cr(VI) involved electrostatic attraction and slightly involved redox reactions. However, it is emphasized that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was very slow and occurred only slightly because of the lack of oxygen-containing functional groups (caused by the pyrolysis process) and the short adsorption period. With increasing experiment time and initial concentration of Cr(VI), the amount of reduced Cr(III) increased gradually. Finally, Cr(VI) is deposited onto the carbon surface, and the formed Cr(III) is released into the aqueous phase due to electronic repulsion between the positively-charged groups and the Cr(III).","4326":"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a bio-based and compostable thermoplastic polyester that has rapidly evolved into a competitive commodity material over the last decade. One key bottleneck in expanding the field of application of PLA is the control of its structure and properties. Therefore, in situ investigations under cooling are necessary for understanding the relationship between them. The most intriguing feature of a supercooled liquid is its dramatic rise in viscosity as it is cooled toward the glass transition temperature (T-g) though accompanied by very little change in the structural features observable by typical X-ray experiments. The deformation behaviors and structure evolution of glassy PLA during uniaxially stretching below Tg were investigated in situ by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) techniques. The stretched samples were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The obtained results showed that the deformation and yield stress of glassy PLA are strongly dependent on the stretching temperatures together with the transition from mesophase to mesocrystal and the formation of cavities. With the increase in drawing temperature, the onset of the mesocrystal formation is delayed to a higher strain value, whereas corresponding to the same critical orientation degree of amorphous chains (f(am) approximate to 0.45). The DSC results indicated that the post-T-g endothermic peak corresponding to the melting of mesocrystal appears and shifts to a higher temperature with increasing stretching temperature, followed by the down-shifts (to a lower temperature) of the exothermic peak of cold crystallization of PLA. The appearance of a small exothermic peak just before the melting peak related to the transition of the alpha' to alpha crystal implies the formation of an alpha' crystal during cold crystallization in the drawn PLA samples. The structure evolution of glassy PLA stretched below T-g was discussed in details.","742":"A facile formulation of room temperature curable polyaniline nanofiber based absorbing inks has been developed. The polyaniline nanofiber and polyaniline nanofiber-graphite composite of 1 mm thickness exhibit average EMI shielding effectiveness of 74 and 87 dB, respectively, in the frequency range 8.2-18 GHz which corresponds to about 100% of electromagnetic attenuation. The polyaniline nanofiber based screen printed layer with a thickness of 50 mm shows an EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of above 13 dB. The screen printed pattern formulated using the graphite incorporated polyaniline nanofiber exhibits an EMI SE of about 17 dB which will prevent 98% of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. The dominant shielding mechanism of polyaniline nanofiber based materials is found to be absorption. The polyaniline nanofiber based screen printed pattern exhibits a faster curing time along with the excellent absorption shielding properties.","5647":"Electromagnetic microwave absorption materials have attracted a great deal of attention. Foams for the low density and tunable porosity are considered as ideal microwave absorbents, while with the requirement of improving their inherent electromagnetic properties. In this manuscript, an innovative, easy, and green method was presented to synthesize an electromagnetic functionalized Ni\/carbon foam, in which the formation of Ni nanoparticles and carbon occurred simultaneously from an affordable alginate\/Ni2+ foam precursor. The resultant Ni\/carbon foam had a low density (0.1 g\/cm(-3)) and high Ni nanoparticles loading (42 wt %). These Ni nanoparticles with a diameter of about 50-100 nm were highly crystallized and evenly embedded in porous graphite carbon without aggregation. Also, the resultant foam had a high surface area (451 m(2) g(-1)) and porosity and showed a moderate conductivity (6 S\/m) and significant magnetism. Due to these special characteristics, the Ni\/carbon foam exhibited greatly enhanced microwave absorption ability. Only with 10 wt % of functional fillers being used in the test template, the Ni\/carbon foam based composite could reach an effective absorption bandwidth (below -10 dB) of 4.5 GHz and the minimum reflection value of -45 dB at 13.3 GHz with a thickness of 2 mm, while the traditional carbon foam and nano-Ni powder both showed very weak microwave absorption (the minimum reflection value <-10 dB). This foam was demonstrated to be a lightweight, high performance, and low filler loading microwave absorbing material. Furthermore, the detailed absorption mechanism of the foam was investigated. The result showed that the derived strong dielectric loss, including conductivity loss, interface polarization loss, weak magnetic loss, and naoporosity, contributes a great electromagnetic absorption.","5221":"Here we demonstrated that high-content nitrogen endowed polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) have not only a doping-dedoping ability but also an inherent hydrophilic property. Combining their rigid chain structures, rough surfaces can be easily achieved by uniformly and firmly coating PANI and PPy onto the surfaces of stainless steel meshes via a simple modified dilute polymerization. Compared to the pristine meshes, the modified meshes become hydrophilic in air and superoleophobic underwater, and maintain stability in various harsh conditions. Taking advantage of this unique wetting feature, PANI and PPy coated meshes were used to separate mixtures of oil and water efficiently.","4250":"This paper demonstrated the feasibility of conducting an enzymatic ring-opening polymerisation by reactive extrusion (REX) at high shear and temperature conditions. Using immobilized Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) as catalyst at temperatures ranging from 90 to 130 degrees C, omega-pentadecalactone (PDL) was converted (>99%) by REX at 60 RPM for 15 min to PPDL with >= M-w 163 000 g mol(-1).","3838":"The sorption of water vapor on high amylose starch was investigated as an alternative desiccant for air-to-air energy exchangers used in ventilation units. Sorption performance of micron-sized mesoporous high amylose starch (HAS(15), d(p) = 15 mu m, P-w = 46 angstrom) and two mesoporous silica gel samples (SG(13), d(p) = 13 mu m, P-w = 62 angstrom; P-w = 62 angstrom; d(p) = 15 mu m, P-w = 77 angstrom) were studied and compared. Transient water vapor sorption tests were performed using small-scale energy exchangers coated with HAS15 and silica gel. Although N-2 gas adsorption tests showed lower sorption capacity for HAS(15) compared to the silica gel samples, higher sorption rates and uptake capacity were shown for HAS15 when measured by water vapor transient sorption results. In addition, the latent effectiveness, an indicator of moisture recovery efficiency for exchangers, exchanger. With the same amount of desiccant coated on the energy exchanger channels, the latent effectiveness of the HAS-coated material was 2%-13% greater than that of the silica gel materials, depending on the operating conditions.","3208":"Nitrogen-functionalized graphene materials have been demonstrated as promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), owning to their respectable activity and,excellent stability in alkaline electrolyte. However, they exhibit unacceptable catalytic activity in acid medium. Here, a hierarchically porous Co-N functionalized graphene aerogel is prepared as an efficient catalyst for the ORR in acid electrolyte. In the preparation process, polyaniline (PANI) is introduced as a pore-forming agent to aid in the self-assembly of graphene species into a porous aerogel networks, and a nitrogen precursor to induce in situ nitrogen doping. Therefore, a Co-N decorated graphene aerogel framework with a large surface area (485 m(2) g(-1)) and an abundance of meso\/macropores is effectively formed after heat treatment. Such highly desired structures can not only expose sufficient active sites for the ORR but also guarantee the fast mass transfer in the catalytic process, which provides significant catalytic activity with positive onset and half wave potentials, low hydrogen peroxide yield, high resistance to methanol crossover, and remarkable stability that is comparable to commercial Pt\/C in acid medium.","4467":"Cell therapy is a promising strategy to regenerate cardiac tissue for myocardial infarction. Injectable hydrogels with conductivity and self-healing ability are highly desirable as cell delivery vehicles for cardiac regeneration. Here, we developed self-healable conductive injectable hydro gels based on chitosan-graft-aniline tetramer (CS-AT) and dibenzaldehyde-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-DA) as cell delivery vehicles for myocardial infarction. Self-healed electroactive hydrogels were obtained after mixing CS-AT and PEG-DA solutions at physiological conditions. Rapid self healing behavior was investigated by rheometer. Swelling behavior, morphology, mechanical strength, electrochemistry, conductivity, adhesiveness to host tissue and antibacterial property of the injectable hydrogels were fully studied. Conductivity of the hydrogels is similar to 10(-3) S.cm(-1), which is quite dose to native cardiac tissue. Proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in the hydrogel showed its good biocompatibility. After injection, viability of C2C12 cells in the hydrogels showed no significant difference with that before injection. Two different cell types were successfully encapsulated in the hydrogels by self-healing effect. Cell delivery profile of C2C12 myoblasts and H9c2 cardiac cells showed a tunable release rate, and in vivo cell retention in the conductive hydrogels was also studied. Subcutaneous injection and in vivo degradation of the hydrogels demonstrated their injectability and biodegradability. Together, these self-healing conductive biodegradable injectable hydrogels are excellent candidates as cell delivery vehicle for cardiac repair.","4538":"The compositions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by Fusarium fungi (F. langsethiae, F. sibiricum, F. poae, and F. sporotrichioides) grown on two nutritive substrates: potato sucrose agar (PSA) and autoclaved wheat kernels (WK) were investigated. The culturing of fungi and study of their VOC emissions were performed in chromatographic vials at room temperature (23 - 24 degrees C) and the VOCs were sampled by a solid-phase microextraction on a 85 mu m carboxen\/polydimethylsiloxane fiber. GC\/MS was performed using a 60-m HP-5 capillary column. Components of the VOC mixture were identified by electron impact mass spectra and chromatographic retention indices (RIs). The most abundant components of the VOC mixture emitted by Fusarium fungi are EtOH, AcOH, (BuOH)-Bu-i, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 2-methylbutan-1-ol, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, terpenes with M 136, sesquiterpenes with M 204 (a total of about 25), and trichodiene. It was found that the strains grown on PSA emit a wider spectrum and larger amount of VOCs compared with those grown on wheat kernels. F. langsethiae strain is the most active VOC producer on both substrates. The use of SPME and GC\/MS also offers the potential for differentiation of fungal species and strains.","1087":"We have developed pH- and magnetic-responsive hydrogels that are stabilized by both covalent bonding and catechol\/Fe3+ ligands. The viscoelastic properties of the gels are regulated by the complexation valence and can be used to tune drug release profiles. The stable incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles further expands control over the mechanical response and drug release, in addition to providing magnetic stimuli-responsivity to the gels.","3836":"Organic fouling in the membrane support is one of the major causes for the flux decline and low efficiency in the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process for osmotic power generation, especially when the fouling is complicated by inorganic salt ions. A facile method to fabricate antifouling hollow fiber membranes was demonstrated in this study, which employed the readily available poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the modification agent. The poly(ether sulfone) (PES) support for the thin film composite (TFC) membranes was first coated by polydopamine (PDA) and then coated with PVA with the aid of glutaraldehyde (GA). PDA was found to detach from the support in the first 2 h and gradually stabilized at pH 2, verifying its applicability for PRO processes. In addition, the existence of a PVA layer was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is important to note that by controlling the reaction conditions, the water flux and salt reverse flux in the PRO process were not sacrificed, proving that the modification can well maintain the porous structure of the support. The modified membranes showed significantly improved fouling resistance to not only alginate but also complex alginate-calcium solutions. The water flux remained similar to 80% instead of similar to 64% in the latter case. Moreover, much of the fouling was converted from irreversible to reversible, which helped enhance the efficiency of physical cleaning to similar to 90%, and hence improved the sustainability of the PRO process.","3624":"Active biocatalysts such as microorganisms or enzymes liberate electrons while electron donors are consumed in biological fuel cells. Biological fuel cells are a novel technology producing bio-electrochemical power using various materials such as complex organic waste or natural organic matter under anaerobic anode conditions. Recently, great attention has been paid to biological fuel cells due to their mild operating conditions and use of a variety of biodegradable substrates as fuel. Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) are a kind of microbial fuel cell (MFC) that can produce electrical current from the organic matter content of sediment using bacterial metabolism. SMFCs have been developed in the past decade to provide a renewable power source and organic matter removal. SMFCs differ from other MFCs due to their essentially complete anoxic conditions at the anode and their membrane-less structure. To further improve SMFC technology, this paper focuses on the limitations and challenges of SMFCs and collects the latest surveys in this field.","6955":"Advanced technologies that can mimic hierarchical architectures found in nature can provide pivotal clues for elucidating numerous biological mechanisms. Herein, a novel technology, spontaneous organization of numerous-layer generation by electrospray (SpONGE), was developed to create self-assembled and multilayered fibrous structures. The simple inclusion of salts in a polymer solution prior to electrospraying was key to mediating the structural versatilities of the fibrous structures. The SpONGE matrix demonstrated great potential as a crucial building block capable of inducing sequential, localized drug delivery or orchestrating cellular distribution invivo, thereby expanding its scope of use to cover a variety of biomedical applications.","5597":"A multi-layer coating composed of SIC inner-layer and Mg and F co-substituted hydroxyapatite\/chitosan hybrid out-layer for carbon fibers has been synthesized using a combination method of chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition and ion exchange method. The morphology, microstructure and in-vitro bioactivity of the multi-layer coating are analyzed. The results show that the SiC inner-layer exhibits a squamous shape. Mg and F co-substituted hydroxyapatite\/chitosan hybrid out-layer covers the SiC inner-layer coated carbon fiber entirely and uniformly with a flat structure. The multi-layer coating could induce the precipitation of particle-shaped apatite crystals with Ca\/P molar ratios of 1.34-1.51 on its surface in simulated body fluid. The multi-layer SiC\/Mg and F co-substituted hydroxyapatite\/chitosan coated carbon fibers should have potential application for tissue engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

H-1 NMR, 2D ROESY NMR, FT-IR and ESI MS studies confirm the inclusion phenomenon, whereas surface tension and conductivity studies indicate a 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the inclusion complexes. The interactions of cyclodextrin with the two named ionic liquids were characterized by density, viscosity and refractive index measurements, while the binding constants have been evaluated using a non-linear programme by the conductivity method, indicating a higher degree of encapsulation in the case of alpha-cyclodextrin than that in beta-cyclodextrin. The formation of the inclusion complexes was elucidated by hydrophobic effects, structural effects, electrostatic forces and H-bonding interactions.","1869":"A good understanding of membrane protein folding at the molecular level requires an effective means to determine the dynamical structural changes on coil-to-helix transition within the cell membrane and as yet remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the amide III spectral signals of the protein backbone, generated in the sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, are a powerful tool to probe the protein folding processes within the membrane in situ, in real time, and without exogenous labels. The amide III signals are capable of separating the spectral profiles of the random-coil and alpha-helical structures at the interface. The intensity ratio of coil and helix peaks becomes a prime indicator that allows one to directly capture the dynamical change of the coil helix transition. With this approach, using pardaxin as a model, the influence of lipid charge on the peptide folding degree at the cell membrane surface has been nicely elucidated. It is evident that the negative charge of the lipid increases the folding degree of pardaxin upon interfacial adsorption and promotes the formation of alpha-helical structure during the insertion of peptides into the lipid bilayer. This robust spectral approach can thus greatly enhance our ability to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in a real cell environment in situ.","6560":"Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs) are the major source of the excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production that replaces liver parenchyma with fibrous tissue during liver fibrosis. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) promotes HCSs survival, proliferation, and activation contributing to fibrogenesis. We have previously used a fragment-based drug design approach and have discovered a novel STAT3 inhibitor, HJC0123. Here, we explored the biological effects of HJC0123 on the fibrogenic properties of HSCs. HJC0123 treatment resulted in the inhibition of HSCs proliferation at submicromolar concentrations. HJC0123 reduced the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of STAT3. It decreased the expression of STAT3-regulated proteins, induced cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis and downregulated SOCS3. HJC0123 treatment inhibited HSCs activation and downregulated ECM protein fibronectin and type I collagen expression. In addition, HJC0123 increased IL-6 production and decreased TGF-beta induced Smad2\/3 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that HJC0123 represents a novel STAT3 inhibitor that suppresses the fibrogenic properties of HSCs, suggesting its therapeutic potential in liver fibrosis.","4423":"One-dimensional SnO2\/TiO2 heterostructures were successfully synthesized through the hydrothermal assembly of the single-crystalline SnO2 nanocubes onto the TiO2 electrospun nanofibers. The as-synthesized heterostructures with controllable coverage density of SnO2 nanocubes were then coated onto the ceramic-based interdigital electrodes to produce the humidity nanosensors for the investigation of their humidity sensing characteristics. The results showed that the optimal nanosensor with similar to 20 at% SnO2-based heterostructure exhibited good humidity sensitivity, fast response-recovery behavior, low humidity hysteresis, and good reproducibility. In particular, the response and recovery times of this optimal nanosensor could reach similar to 2.4 s and similar to 30.2 s, respectively, which were considerably shorter than the corresponding values of TiO2 nanofiber-based humidity nanosensors. The improved sensitivity characteristics for the SnO2\/TiO2 heterostructures can be attributed to the interfacial electron transfer between SnO2 nanocubes and TiO2 nanofibers, which leads to an appropriate height of the potential barrier on the surface of the heterostructures for water adsorption and desorption. Our proposed humidity sensing mechanism would provide opportunities to guide the design and fabrication of other high-performance humidity sensors based on semiconductor heterostructures.","544":"A novel conceptual approach to introduce new features and improve the properties of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) in the bulk state has been devised by introducing a specific compatibilizing agent within the bio-based polymeric building blocks. Here, a new polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-modified poly(DL-lactic acid) (TriPOSS-PLLA) has been developed, and exhibits a homogeneous amorphous phase and good thermal stability in the solid state owing to structural disorder induced by steric hindrance created by bulky tri-POSS. This newly-developed material behaves as an effective compatibilizer and exhibits dramatic improvements in film transparency, crystallization, mechanical performance and barrier properties compared to commercial PLLA. At the optimized blending ratio of 90 wt% PLLA and 10 wt% TriPOSS-PLLA, the composite film has a high optical transmission (over 90%), two-fold higher tensile strength (48.9 MPa) than pristine PLLA and a 33.4% lower oxygen permeation rate than pristine PLLA. Excitingly, hydrolytic degradation experiments indicated that TriPOSS-PLLA does not affect the overall degradation of PLLA. Thus TriPOSS-PLLA has superior mechanical performance and significantly reduced oxygen permeability; both of these properties are highly desirable for environmentally-friendly products in food packaging technologies and other applications.","7319":"Supramolecular polymer networks are materials crosslinked by reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions. Supramolecular materials show very interesting and useful properties resulting from their dynamic nature, such as self-healing, stimuli-responsiveness and adaptability. Here we will discuss recent progress in polymer-based supramolecular networks for the formation of hydrogels and bulk materials.","4048":"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted substantial attention due to their potential application in the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, triangular WSe2 and W(SexS1-x)(2) nanoflakes uniformly dispersed on the surface of electrospun carbon nanofiber mats were synthesized in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. The morphology and structure of these products were systematically characterized, revealing that WSe2 nanoflakes are configured in the 2H phase with high crystallinity, and the W(SexS(1-x))(2) nanoflakes are configured in the alloy form without any obvious phase separation. The hybrid catalyst mats were directly used as hydrogen evolution cathodes to investigate their HER activity. Excellent HER performances, including low overpotential, high current density and long-term stability, were achieved by optimizing the content of the initial W precursor and the appropriate substitution of selenium with sulfur, which resulted from the appropriate cover density and thickness of the WSe2 nanoflakes and the defective structure of the W(SexS(1-x))(2) nanoflakes.","6154":"We herein report the preparation of an Fe-N-doped carbon nanoparticle- carbon nanofiber (Fe-N-CNP-CNF) composite using a solution plasma process followed by heat treatment. The resulting Fe-NCNP-CNF exhibits excellent catalytic activity, durability, andmethanol tolerance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline solution. The enhanced ORR activity of Fe-N-CNP-CNF can reasonably be attributed to the synergistic contributions provided by a high degree of graphitization of CNF, meso\/macroporosity of CNP, presence of catalytically active sites for ORR (i.e., graphitic N and Fe-N bond), and existence of carbon-encapsulated Fe\/Fe3C particles.","3948":"A new cathode material composed of romanechite-structured Na0.31MnO1.9 nanofibers is developed for sodium-ion batteries for the first time.

Contrary to the high temperature phase crystallizing in a KTiOPO4-like structure, this new phase adopts a complex layer-like structure built on FeO4F2 octahedra and SO4 tetrahedra, with potassium cations located in between the layers, as solved using neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with electron diffraction. The detailed analysis of the structure reveals an alternation of edge-and corner-shared FeO4F2 octahedra leading to a large monoclinic cell of 1771.774(7) angstrom(3). The potassium atoms are mobile within the structure as deduced by ionic conductivity measurements and confirmed by the bond valence energy landscape approach thus enabling a partial electrochemical removal of K+ and uptake of Li+ at an average potential of 3.7 V vs. Li+\/Li-0. Finally, neutron diffraction experiments coupled with SQUID measurements reveal a long range antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe2+ magnetic moments below 22 K with a possible magnetoelectric behavior.","6060":"Micro- and nano-sized magnetic adsorbents based on elemental metals, iron oxides, and ferrites and supported by inorganic (carbon, graphene, silica, and zeolites) or organic (macromolecules, polysaccharides, polymers, and biomolecules) compounds are reviewed. The main focus is on magnetic hydrogels, xerogels, and aerogels due to their high number of environmental and biomedical applications. The roles of carbohydrates and polysaccharides (starch, alginic acid, chitosan, etc.) in the stabilisation of magnetic nanoparticles and the use of the formed composites for adsorption purposes are described. Magnetic adsorbents are mainly used for heavy metal removal, for the separation, destruction and adsorption of oil, dyes, toxic organic compounds, several biomolecules and drugs, as well as in a wide variety of catalytic processes. These last applications of magnetic adsorbents, particularly ferrites, are emphasised. The main advantage of magnetic absorbents for these or other possible applications is that the adsorbent or catalyst can be easily removed from the reaction medium after adsorption or reaction completion via a simple magnet. Magnetic behaviour studies of magnetic adsorbents are also discussed.","6311":"For the cell-directed association of nanofibrils, polymeric nanofibrils (NFs) were fabricated by fragmentation of electrospun nanofibers and subsequent surface-decoration with poly(methacrylate) derivatives via ATRP. The decorated NFs showed higher degrees of protein sequestration and enhanced cell proliferation with free infiltration of cells, which leads to hydrogel-like behavior.","6638":"Cross-linked chitosan\/bentonite composite (CCB) was prepared, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, BET surface area and pore diameter analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA). The adsorption of hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) onto CCB as a function of adsorbent dosage, initial Cr(VI) concentration, solution pH, and contact time was investigated through batch experiments. The removal towards Cr(VI) decreased with increasing solution pH from 2 to 11 and initial Cr(VI) concentration, while it increased with increasing adsorbent dosage. The adsorption kinetic data of Cr(VI) on CCB were well described by the pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium data were correlated by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum monolayer Cr(VI) adsorption capacity for CCB at pH 2 and 293 K was 89.13mg\/g. The mechanisms for the adsorption of Cr(VI) on CCB at pH 2 may include electrostatic interaction and chemical interaction between CCB and Cr(VI) ions.","4280":"The aim of the present work was the preparation of a magnetic hydrogel for guided release of sunitinib malate (SUM), an anticancer drug. Precipitation polymerization method has been employed in order to synthesize the hydrogel, using methacrylic acid (MAA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and 2,2 '-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as monomer, cross-linker, pro-hydrophilic monomer and initiator, respectively. To confer magnetic responsiveness, particles of magnetite have been encapsulated during the polymerization process, followed by epoxide ring opening on the nanospheres' surface, in order to obtain a restricted access material (RAM) with low protein adsorption ability and improved biocompatibility. The successful introduction of magnetite has been confirmed through FT-IR and TG analyses, while protein adsorbing tests have been conducted to verify the RAM features. Furthermore, swelling properties have been evaluated before and after epoxide ring opening. Finally, in vitro tests have been performed to evaluate the release profile and cytotoxic effect on ARO, WRO, HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines.","1103":"This review is focused on the fabrication, properties, and applications of hydrogels prepared from two of the most abundant biopolymers on earth, cellulose and chitin. The review emphasizes the latest developments in hydrogel preparation (including solvent systems, cross-linker types, and preparation methods, which determine the \"greenness\" of the process) using these biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymers. The preparation of both physical (without covalent cross-links) and chemical (with covalent cross-links) hydrogels via dissolution\/gelation is discussed. Additionally, formation of injectable thermoset and\/or pH sensitive hydrogels from aqueous solutions of derivatives (chitosan, methyl cellulose, and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) with or without a cross-linker are discussed. This review also compares the design parameters for different applications of various pure and composite hydrogels based on cellulose, chitin, or chitosan, including applications as controlled and targeted drug delivery systems, improved tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dressings, water purification sorbents, and others.","4086":"We have reported a facile method to fabricate drug-loaded hybrid nanofibers for drug sustained release. In our work, a model drug FA was intercalated into the interlayers of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) by ion-exchange intercalation. The particles were dispersed into the PLGA solution to form the electrospun hybrid nanofibers. The intercalation of FA into the LDHs interlayers (MgAl-FA-LDHs) and the composite nanofibers were characterized via different techniques. The results of XRD and FTIR indicate that FA molecules are intercalated into the MgAl-LDHs interlayers. The formed composite nanofibers exhibit a uniform and smooth morphology and the hydrophilicity did not improve significantly. Importantly, the drug-loaded MgAl-FA-LDHs\/PLGA shows a sustained release profile which indicates the MgAl-LDHs can be candidates for drug sustained release.","6829":"Luffa sponge, as a renewable precursor, is used for the first time to synthesize sulfur-doped microporous carbon (SMPC), which is subsequently rolled into an SMPC interlayer that acts as the polysulfide diffusion inhibitor between a sulfur cathode and separator in a Li-S battery. Instrumental analysis shows that the obtained SMPC possesses a unique microporous carbon framework, large specific surface area (3211.2 m(2) g(-1)), high pore volume (1.72 cm(3) g(-1)), good electrical conductivity (1.89 S cm(-1)) and in situ S-doping (2.72 at%). Due to the special physical properties and chemical ingredients of SMPC, the as-fabricated SMPC interlayer for Li-S batteries can not only facilitate rapid electron and Li ion transfer, but can also effectively sequester dissolved polysulfides through combining strong chemical and physical absorption. Consequently, Li-S batteries containing the SMPC interlayer deliver a high initial reversible capacity (1544.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), superior rate capability (781.2 mA h g(-1) at 5C), and excellent cycling stability (over 500 cycles at 2C with 0.057% capacity fading per cycle). This eco-friendly, low cost SMPC interlayer can offer an appealing alternative for the commercialized production of Li-S cells.","2166":"We report the synthesis of ion-exchangeable molybdenum sulfide chalcogel through an oxidative coupling process, using (NH4)(2)MoS4 and iodine. After supercritical drying, the MoSx amorphous aerogel shows a large surface area up to 370 m(2)\/g with a broad range of pore sizes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and pair distribution function analyses reveal that Mo6+ species undergo reduction during network assembly to produce Mo4+-containing species where the chalcogel network consists of [Mo3S13] building blocks comprising triangular Mo metal clusters and S-2(2-) units. The optical band gap of the brown-black chalcogel is similar to 1.36 eV. The ammonium sites present in the molybdenum sulfide chalcogel network are ion-exchangeable with K+ and Cs+ ions. The molybdenum sulfide aerogel exhibits high adsorption selectivities for CO2 and C2H6 over H-2 and CH4. The aerogel also possesses high affinity for iodine and mercury.","2925":"Polydopamine (PD) nanoparticles with mean diameter of 75 nm were synthesized from alkaline solution of dopamine. Morphology and properties of nanostructured PD were characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis. The interaction between PD nanoparticles and L-cysteine, L-methionine as sulfur-containing amino acids and also other usual amino acids in aqueous solutions was investigated. Results demonstrated a selective biosorption of L-cysteine on PD nanoparticles. The effect of some parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, temperature, initial concentration and contact time on biosorption process was investigated. The isotherm adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum uptake capacity of amino acid onto PD nanoparticles was found to be 12.4 mmol g(-1). The kinetic data were fitted well to pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption (the Gibbs free energy, entropy, and enthalpy) were studied.","982":"This work reports a unique in-grown structure of a NiFe-MMO\/CNT hybrid catalyst.

In this study, the fabrication of a matrix composed of MBG nanofibers (MBGNFs) that mimics the three-dimensional structure of the natural extracellular matrix is reported. The fabrication process utilized a sol-gel\/electrospinning technique. The morphology, composition, and structure of the MBGNF matrices were characterized. The MBGNF matrices were typically characterized by highly ordered, one-dimensional channels in a hexagonally packed mesostructure. The drug loading and release profiles of the MBGNF matrices were also investigated. MBGNF matrices had better drug-loading efficiency and could reduce the burst release of gentamicin sulfate and prolong its release over 10 days. Hence, MBGNF matrices are suitable as a drug carrier. Additionally, immersing an MBGNF matrix in a simulated body fluid resulted in the formation of a layer of bone-like apatite minerals on the surface of the MBGNFs. This finding demonstrated the excellent in vitro bioactivity of the MBGNF matrix. Based on a cellular adhesion assay and an analysis of cytoskeletal organization, we determined that MBGNF matrices provided an appropriate environment for cellular adhesion. The observed cellular proliferation; alkaline phosphatase activity; and protein expression levels of osteopontin, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein demonstrated that MBGNF matrices promoted the proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Finally, the bone regeneration ability of the MBGNF matrix was evaluated using a rat calvarial defect model. The results revealed that MBGNF matrices were biodegradable and enhanced bone regeneration. Therefore, given the above results, the MBGNF matrix has the potential to become a new bone graft material for bone tissue engineering applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Both MSNs and DMSNs\/C showed uniform pore size distribution, high specific surface area, and large pore volume. When evaluated as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the DMSNs\/C nanocomposite not only delivered an impressive reversible capacity of 635.7 mAh g(-1) (based on the weight of MSNs in the electrode material) over 200 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) with Coulombic efficiency (CE) above 99% but also exhibited excellent rate capability. The significant improvement of the electrochemical performance was attributed to synergetic effects of the dual-mesoporous structure and carbon coating layer: (i) the dual-porosity structure could increase the contact area and facilitate Li+ diffusion at the interface between the electrolyte and active materials, as well as buffer the volume change of MSNs, and (ii) the homogeneous carbon coating represented an excellent conductive layer, thus significantly speeding the lithiation process of the MSNs significantly, while further restraining the volume expansion. Considering the facile preparation and good lithium storage abilities, the DMSNs\/C nanocomposite holds promise in applications in practical LIBs.","7162":"Herein we report a facile route for the preparation of surface patterned dynamic hydrogel films, which are not only a matrix to encapsulate one type of cell in 3D but also a substrate to support aligned aggregates of magnetic silica rods to adhere another type of cell in 2D. This enables the composite hydrogel films to be flexible scaffolds for engineering multi-cellular tissues.","509":"In this work, we present gas sensors based on ZnO nanoparticle-loaded electrospun SnO2 nanotube (ZnO\/SnO2) n-n heterostructures (HSs) synthesized by electrospinning combined with facile thermal decomposition. The sensing properties of the pristine SnO2 nanotubes (NTs) and ZnO\/SnO2 HSs were investigated toward the representative oxidizing (NO2) and reducing (H-2, CO) gases. Results show that the as-prepared ZnO\/SnO2 HSs exhibit selectively enhanced and diminished sensing performances for oxidizing and reducing gases, respectively. These phenomena are closely associated with the modulation of the local depletion layer on the surface of SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) caused by charge transfer at the heterojunctions due to work function difference. A modified grain boundary-controlled sensing mechanism is proposed to describe charge transport in sensing layers based on the contact potential barriers between nanoparticles. Our study indicates that the selection of material system and their synergism are keys to the effective design of gas sensors with semiconducting metal oxide HSs.","1897":"Keratin-based biomaterials have emerged as potential candidates for various biomedical and biotechnological applications due to their intrinsic biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical durability, and natural abundance. The objective of our study is to explore the feasibility and potential applications of keratin for promoting nitric oxide (NO) release. Herein, keratin was first extracted from human hair and then modified with iodoacetic acid to afford S-carboxymethyl keratin. The amino acid residues, isoelectric point, and molecular weight of keratin were quantified with amino acid analyzer, zeta potential measurement, and SDS-PAGE method. Interestingly, human hair keratin was proved to be capable of promoting NO release from endogenous donor of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in the presence of glutathione. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These modifications were investigated by multinuclear NMR methods in various phospholipid membrane systems. CNTs were found to spontaneously integrate into the superficial layer of membranes at low temperatures; they did not interact with the terminal methyl group of the chains. The local order was increased from C10 to the plateau region of the acyl chain, whereas the local order in the depth was not significantly modified. A specific implication of the choline headgroup was found, resulting in an overall rigidification when CNTs were present. While low-level, athermal radiofrequency exposure in the HF band alone had no significant effect on membrane structure or dynamics, it did partially reverse the consequences of CNT interactions with the membrane by producing a new membrane structure, possibly consistent with gel-or cubic-phase formation.","5210":"This paper reports the first wood derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon-polyaniline (NKWC-PANI) composites, prepared with low-cost, environmentally friendly, and renewable wood wastes as raw materials, for supercapacitor electrode materials. Benefiting from high electrochemical activity of wood derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NKWC) and the synergetic effect between NKWC and polyaniline (PANI) particles, the electrode with the as-obtained NKWC-PANI composite as active material exhibits significantly higher specific capacitance than the electrodes based on pure NKWC and PANI. Moreover, this novel NKWC-PANI composite also shows comparable maximum specific capacitance (347 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) and energy density (44.4 W h kg(-1) at 922 W kg(-1)) to some similar carbon-PANI composites. This work offers a promising method to produce carbon based composite electrode materials with high performance and low cost.","7314":"Biomimetic antibacterial polymers, the functional mimics of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), targeting the bacterial cell membrane have been developed to combat the problem of antibiotic resistance. Amphiphilicity, a balance of cationic charge and hydrophobicity, in these polymers has been shown to be pivotal for their selective interactions with anionic lipid membranes of bacteria instead of zwitterionic mammalian (human erythrocyte) membranes. However, it is unclear if and to what extent hydrogen bonding in amphiphilic antibacterial polymers contributes to this membrane binding specificity. To address this, we employ isosteric substitution of ester with amide moieties that differ in their potency for hydrogen bonding in the side chains of N-alkyl maleimide based amphiphilic polymers. Our studies reveal that amide polymer (AC3P) is a potent antibacterial agent with high membrane-disrupting properties compared to its ester counterpart (EC3P). To understand these differences we performed bio-physical experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which showed strong interactions of AC3P including hydrogen bonding with lipid head groups of bacterial model lipid bilayers, that are absent in EC3P, make them selective for bacterial membranes. Mechanistic investigations of these polymers in bacteria revealed specific membrane disruptive activity leading to the delocalization of cell division related proteins. This unprecedented and unique concept provides an understanding of bacterial membrane interactions highlighting the role of hydrogen bonding. Thus, these findings will have significant implications in efficient design of potent membrane-active agents.","50":"Cellulose acetate (CA) and cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) were homogeneously synthesized in a novel tetrabutylammonium acetate\/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent system, without any catalyst, at temperatures below 70 degrees C. The molecular structures of the cellulose esters (CEs) and distributions of the substituents in the anhydroglucose repeating units were determined using C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the degree of substitution (DS) values were determined using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structures of the CEs, regenerated cellulose (RC), and pulp were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thermal properties of the products were determined using thermogravimetric analysis. The temperatures of initial decomposition of the CEs were up to 40 degrees C higher than those of the RC and pulp. All the CEs were highly soluble in DMSO, but were insoluble in acetone. CAs with DS values less than 2.6 swelled or were poorly dissolved in CHCl3, but those with DS values above 2.9 dissolved rapidly. CAPs with DS values above 2.6 had good solubilities in ethyl acetate.","5138":"Micelles have been employed to encapsulate the supramolecular assembly of quantum dots with palladium(II) porphyrins for the quantification of O-2 levels in aqueous media and in vivo. Forster resonance energy transfer from the quantum dot (QD) to the palladium porphyrin provides a means for signal transduction under both one- and two-photon excitation. The palladium porphyrins are sensitive to O-2 concentrations in the range of 0-160 Torr. The micelle-encapsulated QD-porphyrin assemblies have been employed for in vivo multiphoton imaging and lifetime-based oxygen measurements in mice with chronic dorsal skinfold chambers or cranial windows. Our results establish the utility of the QD-micelle approach for in vivo biological sensing applications.","4157":"Here we characterise the thermal properties of engineered bamboo panels produced in Canada, China, and Colombia. Specimens are processed from either Moso or Guadua bamboo into multi-layered panels for use as cladding, flooring or walling. We utilise the transient plane source method to measure their thermal properties and confirm a linear relationship between density and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we predict the thermal conductivity of a three-phase composite material, as these engineered bamboo products can be described, using micromechanical analysis. This provides important insights on density-thermal conductivity relations in bamboo, and for the first time, enables us to determine the fundamental thermal properties of the bamboo cell wall. Moreover, the density-conductivity relations in bamboo and engineered bamboo products are compared to wood and other engineered wood products. We find that bamboo composites present specific characteristics, for example lower conductivities-particularly at high density-than equivalent timber products. These characteristics are potentially of great interest for low-energy building design. This manuscript fills a gap in existing knowledge on the thermal transport properties of engineered bamboo products, which is critical for both material development and building design.","245":"In this article, we report the development of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) on carbon nanotube (CNT) hydrogels as binder-free electrodes for asymmetric supercapacitors. The CNT hydrogels consisting of three dimensionally inter-connected nanotubes are prepared via a facile sol-gel method. Afterwards, flower-like Mn3O4 is incorporated into CNT hydrogels using a pulse electrochemical deposition. Satisfactory electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 182 F g(-1) (473 mF cm(-2)) is achieved. When employing activated carbon as negative electrodes, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high potential window of 2 V to reach a specific energy of 26.6 W h kg(-1) and a specific power of 5.2 kW kg(-1). These results are much better compared with the results from pure Mn3O4. The remarkable performance of our composites can be ascribed to a highly conducting CNT micro-scaffold and pseudocapacitive Mn3O4.","2191":"Dipeptides are stereo-specifically involved in several biological functions that are challenging to separate enantiomerically. Elution order of enantiomers is an important issue in chiral chromatography. Amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase (CSP) is the best and most-widely-used CSP in chiral separations, but experimental data of enantiomeric separation of dipeptides on this CSP is lacking. Simulation studies were conducted to determine the order of elution and the chiral recognition mechanism of didpetides on this CSP. Results indicated that the docking energy of SR-enantiomers were higher than SS-antipodes. The range of docking energies for SR-enantiomers was -7.44 to -5.92 kcal\/mol with CSP, but -7.15 to -5.87 kcal\/mol for SS-stereoisomers. Therefore it is predicted that SS-enantiomer will elute first, followed by SR-antipode. Furthermore, hydrogen bondings, van der Waal's interactions and electrostatic interactions were observed among SR- and SS-enantiomers and chiral grooves of CSP. The number of hydrogen bonds was one in each enantiomer binding except S-Ala-R-Tyr, which contained two hydrogen bonds. No hydrogen bond was found in S-Ala-R-Trp, S-Leu-S-Trp, and S-Leu-S-Tyr dipeptides bindings. The chiral recognition mechanisms dictate different strengths of stereoselective bindings of the enantiomers on CSP.","1425":"Two kinds of the NiCo2O4 nanosheets constructed by interconnected nanoparticles with different microstructures, including ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NiCo2O4-UNSs) and common NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NiCo2O4-NSs), were controllably synthesized by a facile method. The structure and morphology of the NiCo2O4 nanosheets were analyzed and characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. NiCo2O4-UNSs possess a large surface area (119 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow pore distribution (around 5 nm). Subsequently, the Na-ion storage properties of such NiCo2O4 nanosheets were investigated by sodium half-cells. The ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NiCo2O4-NSs) exhibit much improved performance than that of NiCo2O4-NSs with a high reversible capacity of 690.4 mA h g(-1) at 100 mAg(-1) and 141.8 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 1000 mA g(-1) in the voltage window of 0.01-2.5 V.

The proposed sensor exhibits good sensitivity, good recovery speed and superior performance compared with previously proposed H2S PAni-based sensors. The sensor was fabricated by a simple and low-cost procedure on flexible paper and polyimide substrates. Substrates with pre-fabricated metal electrodes were placed in front of the syringe needle of the electrospinning setup and electrospun nanofibers were deposited directly on the interdigitated electrodes. The effects of several processing and environmental parameters on the morphology of the nanofibers and their sensitivity to H2S have been investigated. The cross-sensitivity of the sensor to nitrogen dioxide and acetone, as two interfering gases, has been explored and the sensor showed good selectivity towards H2S. The proposed sensor can be used in wearable applications and has the potential to be used in a number of applications such as in industrial plants, and in monitoring human body\/mouth odor and foods' freshness.","7078":"We synthesized a new class of polyimides containing a siloxane unit in the main chain and showing an intense photoluminescence (PL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region at room temperature.

However, the lack of good mechanical properties limits its applications. In order to overcome this drawback, CHI has been combined with different polymers and fillers, leading to a variety of chitosan-based nanocomposites. The extensive research on CHI nanocomposites as well as their main biomedical applications are reviewed in this paper. An overview of the different fillers and assembly techniques available to produce CHI nanocomposites is presented.

To obtain the desired materials, the current strategy mainly relies on increasing the thickness of the materials to prolong the transmission routes of microwaves so as to tune the frequency and intensity of absorbed microwave. Unfortunately, these approaches inevitably lead to the increase of mass weight of microwave absorption materials, and the microwave absorbing band may go beyond the targeted bandwidth due to the wave shift caused by the change of the absorber thickness. Herein, a biotemplated synthesis method is developed to fabricate 3D ferromagnetic hierarchical carbon nanofiber bundles (FHCNBs) using natural collagen fibers as the biotemplate, in which ferromagnetic nanoaprticles (NPs) are embedded on the HCNBs with high dispersity. For the as-prepared FHCNBs, the hierarchically nanofibrous structure induced-multiple reflection and scattering are able to enlarge the transmission routes of microwaves, which dramatically improves the microwave attenuation capacity of the ferromagnetic NPs exposed on the FHCNB surface. In this way, a low loading amount of active components (as low as 38.1%) is required for achieving excellent microwave absorption performances (e.g. -36 to -57 dB of reflection loss, 8.6-14 GHz with reflection loss exceeding -10 dB). Importantly, the bandwidth and absorption intensity of microwaves can be effectively tuned by changing the ferromagnetic species (Fe3O4, Fe3N, alpha-Fe, FeTiO3\/Fe3O4 and ZrO2\/Fe3O4) embedded on FHCNBs, which therefore provides a new pathway for the rational realization of truly lightweight and high-performance microwave absorption materials.","538":"The combination of nanotechnology, biology, and bioengineering greatly improved the developments of nanomaterials with unique functions and properties.

Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and XPS proved that an interaction between PANI and VCF formed in the PANI\/VCF composites. The mild treatment did not result in the oxidation and degradation of VCF detected by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and mechanical testing. Moreover, the influence of the reaction conditions including reaction time, aniline monomer (ANI) concentration, ammonium persulfate (APS) concentration and DBSA concentration on the morphology and the conductivity of the PANI\/VCF composites were investigated in detail. The orthogonal experiments were designed to determine the optimal reaction conditions as follows: ethanol\/water ratio (30\/70), reaction time (18 h), ANI concentration (0.1 mol L-1), APS concentration (0.125 mol L-1) and DBSA concentration (0.1 mol L-1).

Subsequently, we described a cell photonic crystal array (CPA) chip, coupling functionalized 3D photonic crystal supraballs with a 96-well plate, establishing a testing platform. By using a microplate reader, multiple signals could be extracted at once, which simplifies the testing process and saves the detection time.

These phantoms were designed to model the formation of thermal lesions in tissues above the threshold temperature of protein denaturation. By adjusting the concentration of acrylic acid (AAc) in the NIPAM-based hydrogel phantoms, the cloud point (i.e., lower critical solution temperature) of the phantoms could be tailored to produce HIFU thermal lesions similar to those formed in different swine tissues in terms of size and shape. Additionally, energy thresholds for inducing transient or permanent bubbles in the phantoms during HIFU ablation were also identified to shed light on the onset of cavitation or material damage. The NIPAM-based hydrogel phantoms developed in this study possess major advantages such as transparent, reusable and tailorable properties, and are practical tools for characterizing an ablative device (or treatment) to determine its efficacy and safety.

The conductivity measurements showed that chitosan-spinach films for all ratios of 95 : 5, 90 : 10, 85 : 15, and 80 : 20 had better conductivity than the chitosan film. The optical band gap reduced with the addition of the spinach extract into chitosan. Chitosan-spinach film with the ratio of 85 : 15 gave the best electrical properties in this work with the conductivity of 3.41 x 10(-6) S\/m and optical band gap of 2.839 eV. SEM-EDX spectra showed the existence of potassium, phosphorus, sulphur, iron, and oxygen in chitosan-spinach films.

Samples of pristine BFO, Ni-doped BFO, and Pb-doped BFO nanofibers were prepared. By incorporating Ni and Pb, additional acceptor states are introduced in BFO. Density functional theory calculations show that Ni prefers to substitute Fe site while Pb substitutes Bi site, resulting in a new deep donor originating from Ni interstitial defects, along with oxygen vacancies (V-o). We find that both the sensing response and recovery time are shorter in samples made of pristine BFO nanofibers than in Ni- and Pb-doped nanofiber samples. We interpret the observed sensing dynamics through charge transport theory of the major (acceptors) and minor (donors) carriers, and found that the minor carrier compensation plays a significant role in determining the response and recovery time of the sensor device.

Through comprehensive investigation of obtained GPE, it is found that the liquid electrolyte uptake reaches up to 230 wt.%; before 100 degrees C, GPE does not lose any weight and is thermal stable; at room temperature the ion conductivity is 3.73 mS cm(-1); the amazing property of lithium ion transference number is high up to 0.85; GPE expresses complete electrochemical stability before 7.5 V and favorable compatibility with lithium anode; the outstanding cell performance of C-rate and cycle capacity. All these remarkably excellent performances endow lignin with application potential in GPE used in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with higher performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It was characterized by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, thermogravimetric analyzer, elemental analyzer, and Hammett indicator. Some acetalization reactions were investigated to evaluate the catalytic activity of CS-VImPS-PW. The results show that CS-VImPS-PW is highly active for the acetalization reactions in high acetal yields ranging from 83.2 to 96.2% and can be reused 8 times without noticeable loss of activity.","2521":"We propose a novel approach to improve the gas-sensing properties of n-type nanofibers (NFs) that involves creation of local pn heterojunctions with p-type reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets (NSs). This work investigates the sensing behaviors of n-SnO2 NFs loaded with p-RGO NSs as a model system. n-SnO2 NFs demonstrated greatly improved gas-sensing performances when loaded with an optimized amount of p-RGO NSs. Loading an optimized amount of RGOs resulted in a 20-fold higher sensor response than that of pristine SnO2 NFs. The sensing mechanism of monolithic SnO2 NFs is based on the joint effects of modulation of the potential barrier at nanograin boundaries and radial modulation of the electron-depletion layer. In addition to the sensing mechanisms described above, enhanced sensing was obtained for p-RGO NS-loaded SnO2 NFs due to creation of local p-n heterojunctions, which not only provided a potential barrier, but also functioned as a local electron absorption reservoir. These mechanisms markedly increased the resistance of SnO2 NFs, and were the origin of intensified resistance modulation during interaction of analyte gases with preadsorbed oxygen species or with the surfaces and grain boundaries of NFs. The approach used in this work can be used to fabricate sensitive gas sensors based on n-type NFs.","6192":"Densely packed nanowires were fabricated by anodizing zinc foil in slightly basic sodium bicarbonate solution. The formation of different nanostructures was observed as a result from varying the reaction parameters such as voltage, electrolyte concentration and time. An in-depth analysis of these formation stages enables a growth mechanism to be proposed. The evolution of anodized-Zn nanostructures could be categorized into four stages, i.e. pitting, growth of nanofibers in pit, formation of nanoflowers and transformation to nanowires. The fabricated nanowires being amorphous in nature, whilst the FTIR measurement revealed the chemical bonds within the nanowires attributed to zinc hydroxy carbonate\/hydrozincite. Hydrozincite nanowires were converted into hexagonal wurtzite ZnO after heat-treatment at 250 degrees C for 1 h as verified by XRD measurement. The overall nanowires form was preserved after annealing but it displayed a granular surface. This surface texture will aid researchers to design\/optimize the total expose surface area and yield device grade performances. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

At present, the most popular thicker in cement and concrete is cellulose ether, especially hydroxy-propyl-methyl cellulose HPMC. This paper reports the different properties between mortars with welan gum or HPMC, as well as standing bleeding rate, mortar fluidity, compressive and adhesive strengths, microstructure by ESEM, rheological properties and electric properties by zeta potential. It was shown that, both welan gum and HPMC are good thickener; however, welan gum has a clear benefit at higher W\/C ratios as much less additive is needed. Both welan gum and HPMC meet adhesion requirements, but welan gum has negligible effect on compressive strength, whereas addition of HPMC results in a very substantial decrease of compressive strength. At high shear rates, mortar with welan gum has better stability than that with HPMC. In water, welan gum forms a three-dimensional threaded network whereas HPMC forms a foil. Under shear conditions, the HPMC foil breaks up beyond recovery, while the welan gum network instead crumples up and unfolds again when shear is removed. In addition, welan gum adsorbs better than HPMC, has greater influence on the zeta potential of cement clinker and changed its electric properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, a Gly-(L-Val)-Gly-(L-Val)-coumarin (GVGV-Cou) conjugate was synthesized, which forms 3D networks in ethanol. The gel nanostructures were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM and TEM. It is suggested that the formation of charge transfer (CT) complexes between the coumarin moieties is the main driving force for the gel formation. The capability of the gel to encapsulate and release dyes was explored. Both Congo Red (CR) and Methylene Blue (MB) can be trapped in the CT gel matrix and released over time. The present gel might be used as a functional soft material for guest encapsulation and release.","6962":"Two optimized cathode configurations (a porous current collector and an interlayer) are utilized to determine the better architecture for improving the cycle stability and reversibility of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells. The electrochemical analysis on the upper-plateau discharge capacity (Q(H)) and the lower-plateau discharge capacity (Q(L)) is introduced for assessing, respectively, the polysulfide retention and the electrochemical reactivity of the cell. The analysis results in line with the expected materials chemistry principles suggest that the interlayer configuration offers stable cell performance for sulfur cathodes. The significance of the interlayer is to block the free migration of the dissolved polysulfides, which is a key factor for immobilizing and continuously utilizing the active material in sulfur cathodes. Accordingly, the carbon mat interlayers provide sulfur cathodes with a high discharge capacity of 864 mA h g(-1) at 1 C rate with a high capacity retention rate of 61% after 400 cycles.","3260":"An interweaved silicon monoxide\/graphite\/carbon nanotubes&carbon nanofibers (SiO\/G\/CNTs&CNFs) composite has been easily synthesized by using high-energy wet ball milling, spray drying in combination with a subsequent chemical vapor deposition method. CNTs&CNFs grow on the interface and the internal interspace of the spherical composite composed of SiO and graphite during the calcination process. The existence of CNTs&CNFs and graphite not only provides a buffer medium to accommodate the volume expansion of SiO during the electrochemical reaction process, but also provides high electrical conductivity for electrode material. When used as an anode material, a reversible specific capacity is approximate 672.3 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), which is about 1.8 times larger than that of the commercial graphite electrode (372 mA g(-1)). Due to the facile synthesis process of the composite and excellent performance of the as-prepared electrode, great commercial potential is envisioned.","4047":"Na-ion batteries have emerged in recent years, due to their advantages of natural abundance, low cost and environmental friendliness. In this article, we review the up-to-date research progress on anode materials for Na-ion batteries from five respects: carbon-based materials, alloy-based materials, metal oxides and sulfides based on conversion reaction, titanium-based compounds with insertion mechanism, and organic composites. In particular, we not only summarize the Na-storage mechanism of these anodes, but also discuss the failure mechanism. The problems and challenges associated with these anodes are pointed out. Furthermore, on the basis of extensive reports and our experimental studies, feasible strategies are suggested for designing high performance anode materials. After further in-depth exploration and investigation, we believe that Na-ion batteries are promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for low cost and large-scale energy storage systems in the near future.","3590":"The formation of alginate gel from low molecular weight alginate and very low molecular weight alginate in the presence of divalent cations was investigated using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The transition from sol to gel in the presence of divalent cations was monitored by the changes in the dynamics of spin labelled alginate. The immobilisation of the spin labelled alginate in the gel reflects the strength of interaction between the cation and alginate chain. Diffusion experiments showed that both the cation and alginate polyanion in the gel fibres can exchange with molecules in solution. In particular, we showed that dissolved alginate polyanions can replace alginates in the gel fibres, which can hence diffuse through the bulk of the gel. This illustrates the surprisingly highly dynamic nature of these gels and opens up the possibility of preparing multicomponent alginate gels via polyanion exchange process.","4262":"In this article, it is demonstrated that the electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) nanofibrous mat functionalized with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane is a versatile platform for the fabrication of hybrid nanofibrous mats by covalently attaching various types of inorganic oxide nanoparticles on the nanofiber surface via a sol-gel process. In particular, SiO2-on-P(VDF-HFP) nanofibrous mats synthesized using this method is an excellent ionic liquid (IL) host for electrolyte applications. The IL-based electrolytes in the form of free-standing mats are obtained by immersing SiO2-on-P(VDF-HFP) mats in two types of liquid electrolytes, namely LiClO4\/1-butyl-3methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt\/1-butyl-1methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide. It is found that the surface attached SiO2 nanoparticles can effectively serve as salt dissociation promoters by interacting with the anions of both ILs and lithium salts through Lewis acid-base interactions. They dramatically enhance the ionic conductivity and lithium transference number of the electrolytes. In addition, better compatibility of the electrolytes with lithium electrodes is also observed in the presence of surface-attached SiO2. Using IL-loaded SiO2-on-P(VDF-HFP) nanofibrous mats as the electrolytes, electrochromic devices display higher transmittance contrast, while Li\/LiCoO2 batteries show significantly improved C-rate performance and cycling stability. This class of novel non-volatile electrolytes with high ionic conductivity also has the potential to be used in other electrochemical devices.","7380":"Hydrogel patterning methods are widely used for cell patterning because they offer better long-term stability than protein patterning methods such as micro-contact printing, but conventional hydrogel patterning methods require special apparatuses such as a laser or an electron beam lithography system or they have complicated chemical operations which prevent their practical use in biological laboratories. A simple method was developed to cast a hydrogel solution without external power sources using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with micro-channels. This study employed \"the accumulation of vacuum pressure\" in a degassed lump of PDMS as a driving force for introducing agarose solution into the micro-channels. Sufficient vacuum pressure could be accumulated within 1 h in the PDMS elastomer that was acting as a vacuum tank, and 2 w\/v% agarose solution could be aspirated into the micro-channels with widths from 100 to 2000 mm and a height of 19 mm, fully filling them. After the gelation and dehydration of agarose solution in the micro-channels, the patterns of agarose gel on the channels were successfully cast with a 90%-width accuracy. By using the repellency of agarose gel toward cell adhesion, patterned cultures of myoblasts and cortical neurons were successfully prepared. This technique is expected to be useful in repellency-guided cell patterning for various types of cells, with applications to cell-cell interactions and axon guidance.","5198":"One-dimensional TiO2 nanofibers were synthesized using an electrospinning method. Subsequently, Ag3PO4\/TiO2 heterostructures were successfully fabricated through a simple deposition-precipitation reaction. The Ag3PO4\/TiO2 heterostructures exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light. The improved photocatalytic activities are attributed to the visible light absorption enhanced by Ag3PO4 and the formation of a heterojunction between TiO2 and Ag3PO4, which can effectively accelerate the charge separation and transfer. The heterostructures can be reclaimed easily by sedimentation without a decrease in the photocatalytic activity due to the large length to diameter ratio of the nanofiber framework.","3620":"Calliviminones C-H (1-6), six novel Diels-Alder adducts of a polymethylated phloroglucinol derivative and acyclic monoterpene (myrcene), were isolated from the fruits of Callistemon viminalis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive analysis of NMR spectroscopic data and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. Compounds 1 and 2 were the first examples of a polymethylated phloroglucinol derivative connected with myrcene in a hetero-Diels-Alder manner and 3-6 were carbon-Diels-Alder adducts featuring an unusual core of spiro-[5.5] undecene. Bioactivity scans indicated that 2-6 showed moderate inhibition on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages.","4564":"Memristors have attracted significant interest in recent years because of their role as a missing electronic component and unique functionality that has not previously existed. Since the first discoveries of the existence of memristive materials, various different fabrication processes for memristors have been presented. Here, a simple additive fabrication process is demonstrated where memristors were deposited on a polymer substrate by conventional inkjet printing. The memristor structure was printed on a 125 mu m thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate by sandwiching a thin layer of TiOx between two silver nanoparticle ink electrodes. Current-voltage (IV) characterization measurements were performed and they showed clear memristive behavior when voltage pulse amplitude varied between-1.5 V and 1.5 V. The corresponding resistance change is approximately between 150 Omega and 75 k Omega. In order to demonstrate the switching scheme in practical application, printed memristors and a printed voltage doubler were connected with a piezoelectric element. The element was subjected to impact-type excitation thus producing an electric charge that was able to switch the memristor between high and low resistive states. These results pave the way for an exploitation of cost-efficient, self-sufficient, all-printable memory elements for wide utilization in future electronics applications.","1263":"In the field of sportswear, the structure and morphology of textiles are of great importance to achieve good moisture transport and low friction, which are two critical comfort-related properties. To improve these properties, dual-layer nanofibrous nonwoven mats were studied in this work. Core-shell nanofibers with a polyaaylonitrile (PAN)-rich core and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-rich shell were fabricated by single-spinneret electrospinning and used as the inner layer of the dual-layer mats, while thick base-treated Cellulose Acetate (CA) nanofibrous mats were used as the outer layer. The core-located PAN and a small amount of PAN on the PAN\/PVDF nanofiber surface ensure good moisture transport through the nanofibrous mats. The synergistic combination of a considerably hydrophobic PAN\/PVDF inner layer and a highly hydrophilic CA outer layer induces a strong push-pull effect, resulting in efficient moisture transport from the inner to the outer layer. Furthermore, the fluorine-rich PVDF shell of the inner layer touches the human skin and provides a lubricating effect to enhance comfortability. This design provides a promising route for sports textiles with both good moisture-wicking and low friction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reaction of alizarin is tunable by changing concentration, solvent polarity, excitation wavelength, and etc. ESIPT reaction of alizarin in the excited state was investigated by steady-state absorption\/emission spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In ethanol solution, the lifetime of PT tautomer of alizarin was measured as 87 ps, in addition to 0.35 and 8.3 ps vibrational cooling dynamics for the LE and PT tautomers of alizarin, respectively. In binary mixtures of ethanol and water, the excited state dynamics became more complicated; the LE and PT tautomers appeared to decay with 8.9 and 30.8 ps lifetimes, which is much shorter compared to the lifetime of the PT tautomer in ethanol. A long-lived nonradiative state in the excited states of alizarin was found as well, which was proposed as a \"trapped\" state with tightly hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The ESIPT reaction of alizarin was blocked in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol-water due to strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules and alizarin, which was further confirmed by the efficient coupling of alizarin to TiO2 nanoparticles in the 1:1 binary mixture of ethanol-water.

Nonaqueous redox-flow batteries have emerged as a promising technology for grid-scale energy storage applications. Because the cost of the system scales with mass, the electroactive materials must have a low equivalent weight (ideally 150 g\/(mol e(-)) or less), and must function with low molecular weight supporting electrolytes such as LiBF4. However, soluble anolyte materials that undergo reversible redox processes in the presence of Li-ion supports are rare. We report the evolutionary design of a series of pyridine-based anolyte materials that exhibit up to two reversible redox couples at low potentials in the presence of Li-ion supporting electrolytes. A combination of cyclic voltammetry of anolyte candidates and independent synthesis of their corresponding charged-states was performed to rapidly screen for the most promising candidates. Results of this workflow provided evidence for possible decomposition pathways of first-generation materials and guided synthetic modifications to improve the stability of anolyte materials under the targeted conditions. This iterative process led to the identification of a promising anolyte material, N-methyl 4-acetylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate. This compound is soluble in nonaqueous solvents, is prepared in a single synthetic step, has a low equivalent weight of 111 g\/(mol e(-)), and undergoes two reversible 1e reductions in the presence of LiBF4 to form reduced products that are stable over days in solution.","2840":"The sensitivity of the phosphate asymmetric stretch vibrational frequency to DNA hydration was investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a spectroscopic map relating the vibrational frequency to the electrostatics of its environment. 95% of the phosphate vibrational frequency shift in fully hydrated DNA was due to water within two hydration layers. The phosphate vibration was relatively insensitive to water in the major and minor grooves and to the sodium counterions but was enormously sensitive to water interacting with the DNA backbone. Comparisons to experimental measurements on DNA as a function of relative humidity suggest that one water molecule per phosphate group likely persists at the lowest values of the relative humidity. Finally, the calculated spectral diffusion dynamics show that water in the vicinity of the DNA backbone is slowed by a factor of similar to 5, in agreement with NMR and solvation dynamics experiments, as well as previous MD simulations.","5275":"Supramolecular systems formed by the binding of several cyclodextrins (CDs) to polymers or lipids, either via non-covalent or covalent links, open a wide range of possibilities for the delivery of active substances. CDs can perform as multifunctionalizable cores to which very diverse ( macro) molecules and drugs can be conjugated. Grafting with amphiphilic molecules can lead to nanoassemblies exhibiting a variety of architectures. CDs can also polymerize with other CDs or can be used to functionalize preexisting polymers to form polymers\/networks with enhanced capability to form inclusion complexes. Alternatively, CDs can be exploited as transient cross-linkers to form poly(pseudo) rotaxane-based networks or zipper-like assemblies. Combination of mutifunctionality and complexation ability of CDs has been shown to be useful to develop depot-like formulations and colloidal nanocarriers with improved performances regarding easiness of administration, protection of the encapsulated substances, control of the delivery rate, and cell interactions. The aim of this review is to provide an overall view of the diversity of designs of CD-based supramolecular nanosystems with a special focus on the advances materialized in the last five years, including clinical trials.","6753":"The ever-increasing demand for renewable and clean power sources has triggered the development of novel materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but how to improve the solar conversion efficiency remains a big challenge. In this work, we report a conceptual strategy in a ternary material system to simultaneously enhance the charge separation and water oxidation efficiency of photoanodes by introducing reduced graphite oxide (rGO) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) on TiO2 nanorod arrays (NAs). An experimental-computational combination study reveals that rGO with a high work function and superior electron mobility accepts photogenerated electrons from TiO2 and enables fast electron transportation; while NiFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. This synergistic effect in this ternary TiO2\/rGO\/NiFe-LDH photoanode gives rise to a largely enhanced photoconversion efficiency (0.58% at 0.13 V) and photocurrent density (1.74 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V). It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density of TiO2\/rGO\/NiFe-LDH, to the best of our knowledge, is superior to previously reported TiO2-based photoanodes in benign and neutral media. In addition, the method presented here can be extended to the preparation of other efficient photoanodes (WO3\/rGO\/NiFe-LDH and alpha-Fe2O3\/rGO\/NiFe-LDH) toward high level PEC performance.","763":"Sulfur is a promising cathode material for lithium batteries as it possesses high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, the practical electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries needs to be improved. In this work, a carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite is synthesized to improve the electrochemical properties of lithium-sulfur batteries. The carbon matrix-sulfur composite is fabricated by deoxidizing the carbon precursor-sulfur composite. Morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of materials have been characterized and tested. Results show that the carbon matrix-sulfur composite envelops carbon nanofibers and sulfur is evenly distributed in the carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite. In a carbon matrix-sulfur composite, sulfur chemically bonds with the carbon matrix. The chemical bonds form in the process of deoxidizing the carbon precursor-sulfur composite. In a carbon nanofibers-sulfur mixture, sulfur is dispersed on carbon nanofibers. In comparison with a carbon nanofibers-sulfur mixture electrode, the carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite electrode exhibits higher discharge capacity and cycle stability. The better electrochemical performance is ascribed to the restriction for dissolution of lithium polysulfides through the adsorbability of the carbon matrix.","6657":"Effectively controlling crystalline phases of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers is crucial to produce membranes with special properties for specific applications. Here, the heating treatment during or after electrospinning has been investigated to determine an effective way to control crystalline phase of PVDF nanofibers. By simultaneously controlling the collector temperature and the flow rate during the fiber deposition, a comparatively lower temperature (a parts per thousand currency sign70 A degrees C) is required for obtaining alpha-, beta-, or gamma-phase-dominant nanofibrous membranes, whereas a much higher temperature (a parts per thousand yen150 A degrees C) is necessary for post-heating of already-deposited fibers. On the other hand, through finely tuning the heating during or after electrospinning, crosslinked nanofibrous membranes can be also obtained, which undoubtedly enhance mechanical performance of the membranes. Therefore, it is hopeful to fabricate high-performance electrospun PVDF nanofibrous membranes with synchronous control of crystalline phases and morphologies, which will further broaden the applications of PVDF materials.","6009":"Structure and interactions stabilising the lamellar stack of mixed lipid bilayers in their fluid state are investigated by means of small-angle X-ray scattering. The (electrically neutral) bilayers are composed of a mixtures of lecithin, a zwitterionic phospholipid, and Simulsol, a non-ionic cosurfactant with an ethoxylated polar head. The soft confinement of the bilayer hydrophilic components is varied by changing hydration and bilayer composition, as well as the length of the cosurfactant polar head. Structural transitions are observed at low hydration, in the stacking order for the longer cosurfactant, and in the mixed bilayers for the shorter one. At higher hydration, the swelling of the lamellar stacks occurs with a significant, but continuous evolution in the mixed bilayer structure. The bilayer structural changes are discussed in analogy with the so-called \"brush-to-mushroom\" transition induced by lateral confinement, relevant for long linear polymers grafted onto rigid surfaces, taking also into account the role of vertical confinement.","4421":"Recently, major efforts have been devoted to exploring cheap and active non-precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells for large-scale applications. Herein, we report electrospun cobalt-carbon nanofibers (Co-CNFs) as an efficient catalyst for the ORR, together with a systematic study of the active site formation. The ORR activity of the Co-CNFs increases with increasing Co content up to approximately 30 wt%, at which high ORR activity is exhibited, comparable with a commercial Pt\/C catalyst in alkaline media. XPS and structural analysis reveals a Co-pyridinic N-x bond at the edge plane, and more Co nanoparticles were found in the Co-CNFs as the Co content was increased. These sites can behave as the primary and the secondary active sites for the ORR, according to a dual-site mechanism. The ORR activity of the Co-CNFs may deteriorate even if only one of these sites is limited. The high ORR activity of the Co-CNF catalysts results from the synergetic effect of dual site formation for the ORR.","1078":"Hybrid mesoporous metal oxides show promising attributes in the field of relative gas sensors due to the combined opportunities provided by the high specific surface area and framework components. In this study, we present the synthesis of Ag-doped ordered mesoporous tin(IV) oxide-titanium(IV) oxide nanohybrids using a sequential combination of a wet impregnation and nanocasting process and demonstrate the response by exposing the mesoporous nanohybrids to ethanol gas. HRTEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption results indicate that the nanohybrids prepared by nanocasting of SBA-15 as the hard template possess an ordered mesoporous structure and high surface area. It was also observed that the mesoporous Ag-(TiO2\/SnO2) shows excellent response towards ethanol with concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 500 ppm. Besides, the nanohybrid mesoporous sensor shows high selectivity towards other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including acetone, methanol, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol and ethyl acetate. All the results indicated that the nanocast mesoporous Ag-(TiO2\/SnO2) nanohybrids have great potential for applications in designing high performance practical ethanol sensors.","435":"The present study was undertaken for characterization of the steady state and non steady state corneal permeation kinetics of diclofenac potassium (DCP) using statistical moment theory. Hydrogel films containing DCP in a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) matrix were prepared by a casting method, and the steady state and non-steady state corneal permeation parameters of diclofenac were evaluated using statistical moment analysis. The correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of non-determination and standard error of estimate (SEE) results indicated a good Level \"A\" correlation between in vitro dissolution and ex vivo steady state permeation of DCP from all the hydrogel formulations. SEM, XRD and DSC studies suggested the inhibition of the crystal growth and partial amorphization of diclofenac in the film. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test revealed that all the hydrogel films containing plasticizer (L2, L3 and L4) show very high significant difference of extent of permeation in non-steady state (EPN), extent of permeation in lag time (EPL), extent of permeation in steady state (EPS) and total amount permeated in 360 min (TAP) from the control film containing no plasticizer (L1) related to highly improved permeation. Marked anti-inflammatory activity has been observed after application of the hydrogel film. The binding configuration of DCP-HPMC using docking calculations indicated drug-excipient interaction at the molecular level. Steady state and non-steady state corneal permeation parameters have been evaluated successfully using statistical moment analysis, and highly improved permeation has been observed when compared to the parameters of the film with the control.","5048":"Smart radiative coating on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrate was prepared by the sol-gel La1-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.125, 0.175 and 0.2) nanoparticles and the binder composed of terpineol and ethyl cellulose. The crystallized structure, grain size, chemical compositions, magnetization and the surface morphology were characterized. The thermal radiative properties of coating in the infrared range was evaluated from infrared reflectance spectra at various temperatures. A single perovskite structure is detected in sol-gel nanoparticles with size 200 nm. Magnetization measurement reveals that room temperature phase transition samples can be obtained by appropriate Sr substitution. The influence of surface conditions and sintering temperature on the emittance of coating was observed. For rough coatings with root-mean-square roughness 640 nm (x = 0.125) and 800 nm (x = 0.175), its emittance increment is 0.24 and 0.26 in in the temperature range of 173-373 K. Increasing sintering temperature to 1673 K, coating emittance variation improves to 0.3 and 0.302 respectively. After mechanical polishing treatment, the emittance increment of coatings are enhanced to 0.31 and 0.3, respectively. The results suggested that the emittance variation can be enhanced by reducing surface roughness and increasing sintering temperature of coating.","1912":"The morphological optimization of Na3V2(PO4)(3) (NVP) material has a great significance for improving the electrochemical performance since NVP suffers from intrinsic low electronic conductivity. For this purpose, a novel 3D NVP nanofiber network is controllably constructed via a facile self-sacrificed template method. Based on time-dependent experiments, an outside-in morphological evolution mechanism from microsphere to 3D nanofiber network is proposed. The as-synthesized material exhibits excellent cyclability (95.9% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 10 C) and enhanced high-rate performance (94 mA h g(-1) at 100 C) for sodium half cell. Notably, when evaluated as full battery (NaTi2(PO4)(3) as anode) cathode, it also shows outstanding cycling stability (96.9% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability (80 mA h g(-1) at 50 C). Such remarkable performance is attributed to the 3D nanofiber network structure, which provides multi-channel ionic diffusion pathway, continuous electronic conduction, and improved structural integrity. This self-sacrificed template strategy presented here can inspire new thought in constructing novel nanofiber\/nanowire structures and accelerate the development of high-power sodium-ion batteries.

Despite their key importance in multiple industires, to-date there has been little emphasis on environmental systems analysis of REE production. Rapid growth in these industrial sectors could result in hightened global demand for REE. As such, assessing the broader ramifications of REE production on human health and the environment is crucial for guiding the sustainable and development of these industries. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to evaluate the environmental impacts and resource intensity of producing rare earth oxides (REO) from the Bayan Obo mine located in Inner Mongolia, China. Analysis indicates that the mining, as well as extraction and roasting phase(S), had the greatest contribution to overall life cycle environmental impacts. Additionally, the results reveal that the production of heavy REO consumes over 20 times more primary energy as compared to steel (per unit mass). The high energy consumption and life cycle environmental impacts of REO production highlight the critical need for development of REE recycling operations and infrastrcture.","2440":"A Gaussian, visible laser beam traveling in a hydrogel doped with NaI and Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2 spontaneously transforms into a localized, self-trapped beam, which propagates without diverging through the medium. The catalytic, laser-light-induced oxidation of I- by [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) generates I-3(-) species, which create a refractive index increase along the beam path. The result is a cylindrical waveguide, which traps the optical field as bound modes and suppresses natural diffraction. When the beam is switched off, diffusion of I-3(-) erases the waveguide within minutes and the system reverts to its original composition, enabling regeneration of the self-trapped beam. Our findings demonstrate reversible self-trapping for the first time in a precisely controllable, molecular-level photoreaction and could open routes to circuitry-free photonics devices powered by the interactions of switchable self-trapped beams.","1320":"Self-supported and flexible highly porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) were prepared by electrospinning method combined with a post-two-step carbonization process. By introduction of air into the Ar flow during carbonization, carbon nanofibers were partially burnt off and a large number of micro\/mesopores were created. As effective lithium storage units, the porous structure plays an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performances. The HPCNFs delivers a reversible capacity as high as 1780 mAh g(-1) after 40 cycles at 50 mA g(-1) and ultralong cycle life (1550 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 500 mA g(-1)). Even cycled at 25 A g(-1), it still displays a very high capacity of 200 mAh g(-1) The outstanding electrochemical and mechanical properties of HPCNFs are attributed to the novel structure: pores provide good access of the electrolyte to the electrode surface and facilitate fast charge transfer across the electrode\/electrolyte interface. 3D interconnected networks decrease the contact resistance and improve electrical conductivity of the overall electrode, which enhance electron transport rate. Therefore, this novel carbon material holds great promise for potential applications in energy-related technological and flexible electrodes for next generation LIBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The bio-fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass are popularly referred to as second-generation bio-fuels. To date, several thermochemical conversion pathways for the production of second-generation bio-fuels have shown commercial promise; however, most of these remain at various pre-commercial stages. In view of their imminent commercialization, it is important to conduct a profound and comprehensive comparison of these production techniques. Accordingly, the scope of this review is to fill this essential knowledge gap by mapping the entire value chain of second-generation bio-fuels from technical, economic, and environmental perspectives. This value chain covers (i) the thermochemical technologies used to convert solid biomass feedstock into easier-to-handle intermediates, such as bio-oil, syngas, methanol, and Fischer-Tropsch fuel; and (ii) the upgrading technologies used to convert intermediates into end products, including diesel, gasoline, renewable jet fuels, hydrogen, char, olefins, and oxygenated compounds. This review also provides an economic and commercial assessment of these technologies, with the aim of identifying the most adaptable technology for the production of bio-fuels, fuel additives, and bio-chemicals. A detailed mapping of the carbon footprints of the various thermochemical routes to second-generation bio-fuels is also carried out. The review concludes by identifying key challenges and future trends for second-generation petroleum substitute bio-fuels.","7071":"Introducing flexibility and high porosity into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) is one of the critical challenges for the next generation of multifunctional energy storage and CO2 adsorption materials. Herein, we developed an efficient strategy for the controllable fabrication of a flexible and mechanically robust Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) doped CNFs (CNFs-Co) hybrid membrane via electrospinning and subsequent carbonization treatment. The quantitative pore size distribution and fractal analysis revealed that the CNFs-Co possessed a tunable porous structure with high surface area of 483 m(2) g(-1). Therefore, it exhibited exceptional performance in CO2 capture, i.e. a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 5.4 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar and room temperature. Electrochemical measurements performed on CNFs-Co for supercapacitor applications demonstrated very high capacitance of up to similar to 911 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) (76% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) in 1 M H2SO4 solution. The successful synthesis of this hybrid membrane may also provide new insights towards the development of materials for various multifunctional applications.","2650":"New materials hold the key to fundamental advances in energy conversion and storage, both of which are vital in order to meet the challenge of sustainable and renewable energy sources. Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) represent an important strategy for electrochemical energy storage, but are usually limited by relatively low energy density. In this study we assembled a hybrid LIC featuring a bulk graphdiyne (GDY) anode and an activated carbon (AC) cathode. This capacitor delivered an initial specific energy as high as 112.2 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 400.1 W h kg(-1), with 94.7% retention after 1000 cycles. More importantly, it even displayed an energy density of 95.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1000.4 W kg(-1), operated in the voltage range of 2-4 V. Those high energy and power densities in LICs constructed with GDY anode and AC cathode offer a great potential toward application on next generation batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The short cellulose fibers were size-reduced to micro and nano levels prior to coating with polyaniline. Fiber surface was coated with Polyaniline (PANI) by an in situ polymerization technique in aqueous medium. The composites were then prepared by solution casting method. Short cellulose fiber composites showed a dielectric constant (DEC) of 2.3 x 10(5) at 40 Hz. For the micro-and nano-cellulose fiber composites the DEC was increased to 4.5 x 10(5) and 1.3 x 10(8), respectively. To gain insight into the inflection point of the dielectric data polynomial regression analysis was carried out. The loss tangent of all the composites remained at less than 1.5. Further, AC conductivity, real and imaginary electric moduli of all the composites were evaluated. PVA nanocomposite attained an AC conductivity of 3 S\/m. These showed that by controlling the size of the fiber used, it was possible to tune the permittivity and dielectric loss to desired values over a wide range. These novel nanocomposites, combining high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss, can be effectively used in applications such as high-charge storage capacitors.

TiO2-Hb composite was casted on the surface of CILE with a chitosan film and spectroscopic results confirmed that Hb retained its native structure in the composite. Direct electron transfer of Hb on the modified electrode was realized with a pair of quasi-reversible redox waves appeared, indicating that the presence of TiO2 nanowires could accelerate the electron transfer rate between the electroactive center of Hb and the substrate electrode. Electrochemical behaviors of Hb on the modified electrode were carefully investigated with the values of the electron transfer coefficient (), the electron transfer number and the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (k(s)) as 0.58, 0.98 and 1.62 s(-1).

Transition metal oxides as the promising candidates are impeded by their limited electronic conductivity and low intrinsic activity. In this work, we propose a strategy of lower valence-state doping for ramsdellite-MnO2 to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are effective to improve the conductivity and activity of ramsdellite-MnO2. Using DFT + U calculations, we find out that the formation energies of oxygen vacancies both in the bulk and on the surface of ramsdellite-MnO2 are decreased apparently after Zn doping. Notably, the surface oxygen vacancies could form spontaneously without any other impetus. In addition, the bulk Zn dopants will provide the enhanced electrons diffusion to the surface, and the positive surface oxygen vacancies will draw the electrons to the reaction sites. In the reaction sites, the oxygen vacancies and reduced Mn ions will improve the activity of the electrode reactions. This may be anticipated to improve the electrochemical performance of the similar binary metal oxides.","4247":"Long-persistence silicate luminescent nanofibers doped with rare earths ( Sr2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+) were successfully prepared via electrospinning technique combined with calcination method, and long-lasting silicate phosphors ( Sr2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+) with the same stoichiometric proportion as the nanofibers were prepared by sol-gel method. The morphology, crystal structure, photoluminescence and thermoluminescence properties of the nanofibers compared with the phosphors were investigated. The average diameter of the Sr2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+ luminescent nanofibers was 350 nm, and the whole shape of the nanofibers was consecutive which seemed like pearl necklace. The synthesis temperature of the Sr2MgSi2O7: Eu2+, Dy3+ luminescent nanofibers was 1100 degrees C which lower 200 degrees C than phosphors. The excitation spectrum of the nanofibers moved to short wavelength direction compared with the phosphors, and the nanofibers could reveal a bright blue light after been excited by UV light at 365 nm. The initial afterglow intensity of the nanofibers was 1.26 cd . m(-2), and the afterglow decay curve of the nanofibers was similar to phosphors. Even though the depth of the traps of the luminescent nanofibers was shallower than phosphors, the nanofibers still presented strong afterglow intensity and long decay time.

With increasing of temperature and magnetic field, MR effect of isotropic MRE can each up to as high as 4176.5% at temperature of 80 degrees C, and the mechanism of the temperature-dependent in presence of magnetic held was discussed.

A hierarchical nanoporous (HNP) AuAg alloy with the advantages of a large surface area, excellent structure stability, and rich pore channels is used as an hCG antibody carrier for the preparation of a highly sensitive immunosensor. The HNP-AuAg alloy with bimodal ligament\/pore size distribution is fabricated by means of simple dealloying and redealloying of the AuAgAl source alloy combined with an annealing operation. Graphene sheets (GS) and ionic liquid (IL) composites have been introduced as transducing materials to modify the conductivity as well promote the electron transfer in the immunosensor. Based on the dual-amplification effects of the HNP-AuAg alloy and the IL\/GS composite film, the constructed immunosensor exhibits an enhanced performance for hCG detection compared with that based on single nanoporous (NP) Au, including a lower detection limit of 0.01 ng mL(-1) and wider linear range from 0.05 to 35.0 ng mL(-1).

This perspective considers the role of interface science in energy harvesting using organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These interfaces include large surface area junctions between photoelectrodes and dyes, the interlayer grain boundaries within the photoanodes, and the interfaces between photoactive layers and the top and bottom contacts. Controlling the collection and minimizing the trapping of charge carriers at these boundaries is crucial to overall power conversion efficiency of solar cells. Similarly, MOS photocatalysts exhibit strong variations in their photocatalytic activities as a function of band structure and surface states. Here, the MOS interface plays a vital role in the generation of OH radicals, which forms the basis of the photocatalytic processes. The physical chemistry and materials science of these MOS interfaces and their influence on device performance are also discussed.","1056":"In the present study, a new sequential process for wastewater remediation in two steps with high durability was presented. Firstly, dye uptake on TiO2-loaded chitosan-graft-poly(2- and 3-methylaniline) nanocomposites was observed in the dark. Secondly, sunlight-assisted photocatalytic self-cleaning for regeneration of the used adsorbent was achieved. Thus a synergic effect of adsorption\/ photooxidation for successful removal of dye from aqueous solutions was manifested. The nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, XRD, and TEM. The data of dye adsorption were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The Langmuir model gave the best fit. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order were used to analyze the kinetic data. The data fit well with the second-order kinetic model. The adsorptive removal of the dye was highly efficient. Interestingly, the adsorbents were successfully regenerated by photomineralizing the adsorbed dye via solar-assisted self-cleaning. Efficient photocatalytic ability as reflected from the estimated photodegradation rate of the dye was observed. Furthermore, the prepared materials showed good photocatalytic stability after five runs under solar light. The (OH)-O-center dot detected from the photoluminescence - terephthalic acid technique along with O-center dot(2)- species seem to be the oxidizing species responsible for the sunlight-driven photodegradation reaction.","6693":"Guanosine 5'-monophosphate, (5'-GMP), is a self-assembling natural nucleotide that has unique potential to form ordered supramolecular structures.

In this work, spherical CaCO3 was synthesized via coprecipitation in the presence of SF. SF nanostructures were first tuned by self-assembly at 60 degrees C to provide better control of the nucleation of CaCO3. Subsequently, monodisperse vaterite microspheres about 1.1 mu m were generated by controlling aggregation and growth of CaCO3 under appropriate concentrations of SF and Ca ions. In contrast to unstable vaterite, the microspheres generated in the present study have sufficient stability in aqueous solution for at least 8 days without transformation into calcite, due to the electrostatic interactions between the Ca ions and the preassembled SF nanostructures. The microspheres as drug carriers of doxorubicin (DOX) were assessed and found to have good encapsulation efficiency, sustained drug release without burst release, and pH sensitivity. These new SF\/CaCO3 hybrids may provide new options for various biomedical applications.","5300":"A sandwiched symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor consisting of flexible electrospun polyaniline (PANI)\/carbonized polyimide (CPI) nanocomposite membrane electrodes and a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)\/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) nanofiber membrane-reinforced PVA\/H3PO4 gel separator has been successfully fabricated. Needle-like PANI nanoparticles are vertically formed on the high electrically conductive three-dimensional CPI nanofiber network, resulting in an efficiently improved specific surface area of the PANI nanoparticles and faster electrolyte ion penetration and electron transfer in the active electrode material. The synergistic effect thus generates remarkably higher specific capacitance of 379 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and longer cycle life with a retention of 94% at 1 A g(-1) for PANI\/CPI nanocomposite membrane electrodes, compared with those (209 F g (1), 56%) of neat PANI powder. Furthermore, electrospun PVA\/PAA nanofiber membrane-reinforced PVA\/H3PO4 gel separator exhibits superior mechanical properties over the traditional PVA\/H3PO4 gel separator, thus endowing the entire device with high flexibility and foldability. Therefore, electrospinning is a very promising technique for the preparation of highly flexible and foldable electrode and separator materials with hierarchical structures in high-performance new energy storage applications.","1888":"The paper reports the thermo-therapeutic applications of chitosan-and PEG-coated nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles. In this study NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by the co-precipitation method, tuning the particle size through heat treatment in the temperature range from 200-800 degrees C for 3 h. XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the the ultrafine nanoparticles were of size 2-58 nm. Crystallinity of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in the as-dried condition with the particle size similar to 2-3 nm was confirmed from the presence of a lattice fringe in the HRTEM image. VSM measurements showed that a superparamagnetic\/ferromagnetic transition occurs with increasing particle size, which was further confirmed by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The nickel ferrite nanoparticles with optimum particle size of 10 nm were then coated with materials commonly used for biomedical applications, i.e. chitosan and PEG, to form homogeneous suspensions. The hydrodynamic diameter and the polydispersity index (PDI) were analyzed by dynamic light scattering at the physiological temperature of 37 degrees C and found to be 187 nm and 0.21 for chitosan-coated nanoparticles and 285 nm and 0.32 for PEG-coated ones. The specific loss power of rf induction heating by the set-up for hyperthermia and r(2) relaxivity by the nuclear magnetic resonance were determined. The results of induction heating measurements showed that the temperature attained by the nanoparticles of size 10 nm and concentration of about 20 mg ml(-1) was >70 degrees C (for chitosan) and >64 degrees C (for PEG). It has been demonstrated that the required temperature for hyperthermia heating could be tuned by tuning the particle size, shape and magnetization and the concentration of solution. For other potential biomedical applications of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticle solution, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging, the NMR studies yielded the T-1 and T-2 relaxivities as 0.348 and 89 mM(-1) s(-1) respectively. The fact that the T-2 relaxivity is orders of magnitude higher than T-1 indicates that this is suitable as a T-2 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging.","7217":"We have fabricated, for the first time, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) employing pseudocapacitive copper oxide (CuO) as anode and electrochemical double layer capacitive commercial activated carbon (AC) as cathode. The CuO is in the form of nanowires of diameter similar to 30-50 nm developed using an aqueous polymeric solution based electrospinning process. The ASC showed larger voltage window (V similar to 1.6 V) and specific capacitance (C-S similar to 83 Fg(-1)) than a control symmetric electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) (V similar to 1.4 V; C-S similar to 33 Fg(-1)) fabricated using the AC. The ASC delivered specific energy densities (E-S) of 29.5, 23.5, 19.2 and 16.4Wh kg(-1) at specific power densities (P-S) 800, 1500, 4000 and 8400 W kg(-1), respectively. The performance of ASC is much superior to the control EDLC, which delivered E-S of 11, 10 and 8.8 W h kg(-1) at P-S 800, 1600 and 3900 W kg(-1), respectively.

Homogenous sols comprising polyvinylpyrolidine (PVP), Pluronic F127 and CTO (metal salt) were electrospun, which resulted in fine CTO nanotubes due to phase separation phenomenon. PVP\/CTO molar ratio was confirmed to induce the effective manipulation of its structural characteristics. Altering the ratio from 0.24 m to 0.12 m was found to result in the increased fiber diameter, from similar to 105 nm to similar to 230 nm, and the enhanced hollow structure (diameter of similar to 70 nm).

Also, because of the highly active nature of the sodium metal, the conventional room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery concept with the sodium-metal anode and elemental sulfur cathode imposes serious safety concerns. To overcome the above difficulties, we present here a RT Na-S system with an advanced membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) comprising a carbon-coated, presodiated Nafion membrane (Na-Nafion) and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode. The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the migration of the polysulfides to the anode. The carbon coating on the Na-Nafion plays an upper-current-collector role and thereby improves the electrochemical utilization of the active Na2S. Employing Na2S as the cathode provides a pathway to develop the RT Na-S batteries with sodium metal-free anodes. The RT Na-S battery with the above MEA exhibits remarkably enhanced capacity and cyclability in contrast to the Na-S batteries with the conventional electrolyte-separator configuration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the suppression of polysulfide migration through the Na-Nafion is due to size and electronic effects.","1483":"The screening conditions of an existing column and mobile phase selection strategy for chiral compounds in normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) were tested for their applicability on Chiralpak IC, which is a chiral stationary phase (CSP) made by immobilising cellulosic tris (3,5-dichlorophenyl-carbamate) on silica gel. In this study, the applicability of the optimization steps of the existing separation strategy was examined using 36 compounds representing the three possible resolution situations that occur after screening.

The structural, morphological and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles were characterized, and their usefulness as nano-heaters in magnetic hyperthermia was explored. The specific loss powers obtained for all CoFe2O4 nanoparticles in water shared similar magnitudes and were attributed to a dominant Brown relaxation. The nanoparticles obtained after template calcination at 550 degrees C display morphologies determined by the threaded templates, with enhanced magnetic anisotropy and associated magnetic coercivities similar to that of nanofibers or nanorods.","354":"BACKGROUNDMagnetic adsorption is currently a popular way to remove chemical pollutants from water. The present work reported highly efficient removal of methylene blue (MB) by magnetically retrievable carbon-decorated lignocellulose fiber (mC@LCF). RESULTSCarbon-decorated lignocellulose fiber (C@LCF) was successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal carbonization process using a low-cost and environment-friendly lignocellulose fiber (LCF) as raw material. Further, the C@LCF was in situ magnetized by simply adding it and magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) into methylene blue (MB) solution taking advantage of the spontaneous behavior of MNP adherence to the surface of C@LCF. During this period, MB was efficiently removed, and the maximum removal capacity was 232.3 mg g(-1) at 303.15 K. Kinetic and thermodynamic investigations as well as isotherm analysis were also undertaken. Reusability of mC@LCF was evaluated, and results showed that removal of MB exceeded 90% after seven consecutive cycles. CONCLUSIONSThe mC@LCF has obvious advantages including ease of production, low production costs, environmental friendliness, magnetic retrievability, and high efficiency for MB adsorption. Thus mC@LCF is a promising adsorbent for the purification of dye-containing wastewater.

The geometric model of the cells takes into account the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus, as well as the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. Material properties are varied within a pathophysiologically-relevant range. A first modal analysis reveals the existence of a spectral gap between the natural frequencies and, most importantly, resonant growth rates of healthy and cancerous cells. The results of the modal analysis are verified by simulating the fully-nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous cells at resonance. The fully nonlinear analysis confirms that cancerous cells can be selectively taken to lysis by the application of carefully tuned ultrasound harmonic excitation while simultaneously leaving healthy cells intact.

Recently, potential health benefits of astaxanthin have been discussed which may be partly related to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. Our electron spin resonance (ESR) and spin trapping data suggest that synthetic astaxanthin is a potent free radical scavenger in terms of diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and galvinoxyl free radicals. Furthermore, astaxanthin dose-dependently quenched singlet oxygen as determined by photon counting. In addition to free radical scavenging and singlet oxygen quenching properties, astaxanthin induced the antioxidant enzyme paroxoanase-1, enhanced glutathione concentrations and prevented lipid peroxidation in cultured hepatocytes. Present results suggest that, beyond its coloring properties, synthetic astaxanthin exhibits free radical scavenging, singlet oxygen quenching, and antioxidant activities which could probably positively affect animal and human health.","2445":"An efficient and multifunctional brucite\/3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)\/nickel alginate\/APTES (B\/A\/Nia\/A) hybrid flame retardant was fabricated via the layer-by-layer assembly technique with brucite, silane coupling agents, nickel chloride, and sodium alginate. The morphology, chemical composition, and structure of the hybrid flame retardant were characterized. The results confirmed the multi layer structure and indicated that the assembled driving forces were electrostatic interactions, dehydration condensation, hydrogen bonds, and coordination bonds. When used in ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) resin, the multifunctional flame retardant had better performance than brucite in improving the flame retardancy, smoke suppression, and mechanical properties. With 130 phr loading, the multifunctional flame retardant achieved a limiting oxygen index value of 32.3% and a UL 94 V-0 rating, whereas the brucite achieved only 31.1% and a V-2 rating, respectively. The peak heat release rate and, total heat released decreased by 41.5% and 8.9%, respectively. The multifunctional flame retardant had an excellent performance in reducing the smoke, CO, and CO2,production rates: These improvements could be attributed to the catalyzing carbonization of nickel compounds and the formation of more protective char layers. Moreover, the elongation at break increased by 97.5%, which benefited from the improved compatibility and the sacrificial bonds in the nickel alginate. The mechanism of flame retardant, smoke suppression, and toughening is proposed.","2855":"The aim of this study was to explore the influence of amphiphilic and zwitterionic structures on the resistance of protein adsorption to peptide self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and gain insight into the associated antifouling mechanism. Two kinds of cysteine-terminated heptapeptides were studied. One peptide had alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues with an amphiphilic sequence of CYSYSYS. The other peptide (CRERERE) was zwitterionic. Both peptides were covalently attached onto gold substrates via gold thiol bond formation. Surface plasmon resonance analysis results showed that both peptide SAMs had ultralow or low protein adsorption amounts of 1.97-11.78 ng\/cm(2) in the presence of single proteins. The zwitterionic peptide showed relatively higher antifouling ability with single proteins and natural complex protein media. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to understand their respective antifouling behaviors. The results indicated that strong surface hydration of peptide SAMs contributes to fouling resistance by impeding interactions with proteins. Compared to the CYSYSYS peptide, more water molecules were predicted to form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the zwitterionic CRERERE peptide, which is in agreement with the antifouling test results. These findings reveal a clear relation between peptide structures and resistance to protein adsorption, facilitating the development of novel peptide-containing antifouling materials.","3707":"We report the synthesis of genipin cross-linked polyionic complex (PIC) micelles by mixing a pH-sensitive\/disulfide-based polymer, poly(DTPA-co-cysam), which was synthesized by copolymerization of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (DTPA) dianhydride with cystamine, and a pH-sensitive copolymer, polyethylene glycol-block-poly(L-lysine) (PEG-b-PLL), with the aid of metal ion and subsequent cross-link. Their size and colloidal property were found to be determined by mixing weight percentage, polymer molecular weight, and metal ion. Upon genipin cross-link, the cross-linked compound not only stabilizes the assembled nanostructures but also induces red fluorescence, which is promising as a fluorescent probe for cell imaging. The experimental data suggested that the emission of red fluorescence may result from the presence of carboxyl group in the compact, cross-linked micelles. These genipin cross-linked PIC micelles were found to be biocompatible toward fibroblast 3T3 cells and exhibited noticeable pH-sensitive and glutathione-cleavable behavior based on doxorubicin (DOX) release experiments, suggesting that they are promising stimuli-responsive drug vehicles. The drug release behavior was found to depend on particle\/membrane permeability and the percentage of amino group in the particles\/membranes. This approach provides a simple and facile method to prepare multifunctional, cross-linked micelles by properly design of constituent homopolymer\/copolymer for specific purpose.","2447":"Carbons are the main electrode materials used in electrochemical capacitors, which are electrochemical energy storage devices with high power densities and long cycling lifetimes. However, increasing their energy density will improve their potential for commercial implementation. In this regard, the use of high surface area carbons and high voltage electrolytes are well-known strategies to increase the attainable energy density, and lately ionic liquids (ILs) have been explored as promising alternatives to current stateof- the-art acetonitrile-based electrolytes. Also, in terms of safety and sustainability, ILs are attractive electrolyte materials for electrochemical capacitors. In addition, it has been shown that the matching of the carbon pore size with the electrolyte ion size further increases the attainable electric double layer (EDL) capacitance and energy density. The use of pseudocapacitive reactions can significantly increase the attainable energy density, and quinonic-based materials offer a potentially sustainable and cost-effective research avenue for both the electrode and the electrolyte. This perspective will provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art research on electrochemical capacitors based on combinations of carbons, ILs, and quinonic compounds, highlighting performances and challenges and discussing possible future research avenues.

The PAMAM\/DLPN layers were then exposed to short oligonucleotides, polynucleotides and single stranded DNA (ssDNA). The interfacial properties were characterized using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and neutron reflectometry. Both types of DLPN were found to adsorb as aggregates to preadsorbed PAMAM monolayers with a similar interfacial structure and composition before rinsing with pure aqueous solution. Nucleic acids were found to interact with PAMAM\/DLPA layers due to base pairing interactions, while the PAMAM\/DLPU layers did not have the same capability. This was attributed to the structure of the DLPA layer, which is formed by aggregates that extend from the interface towards the bulk after rinsing with pure solvent, while the DLPU layer forms compact structures. In complementary experiments using a different protocol, premixed PAMAM\/DLPN samples adsorbed to hydrophilic silica only when the mixtures contained positively charged aggregates, which is rationalized in terms of electrostatic forces. The PAMAM\/DLPA layers formed from the adsorption of these mixtures also bind ssDNA although in this case the adsorption is mediated by the opposite charges of the film and the nucleic acid rather than specific base pairing. The observed molecular recognition of nucleic acids by dendrimers functionalized via non-covalent interactions with nucleolipids is discussed in terms of biomedical applications such as gene vectors and biosensors.","4985":"A facile and efficient way to impart compelling chemical functionality is the utilization of bio-relatedmaterials that are easily accessible from natural products. Here, inspired by anomalous physicochemical features and natural abundance of agarose, we demonstrate a new class of agarose-biofunctionalized, dual-electrospun heteronanofiber mats as a chemically active separator membrane for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. The agarose-enabled metal ion chelation effect of the separator membrane, in combination with its highly porous structure and superior electrolyte wettability, provides unprecedented improvement in cell performance far beyond those accessible with conventional battery separator membranes.","91":"Identifying the mechanisms of nanoparticle (NP) interactions with cell membranes is key to understanding potential NP cytotoxicity and applications as nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery. To elucidate these mechanisms of interaction, supported phospholipid bilayers (SPBs) are commonly used as models of cell: membranes. However, SPBs are soft thin films, and, as such, their properties can be significantly affected by the underlying substrate. Free-floating cell membranes would be best modeled by weakly adhered SPBs; thus, we propose a method for tailoring the interfacial interaction of an electrically charged SPB-substrate system based on modulations in the solution chemistry. Using the dissipation signal of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), we show that the method can be used to tailor SPB-substrate interactions without the loss of its structural integrity. To demonstrate the application of die method, SPBs are exposed to cationic and anionic polystyrene latex NPs. These studies reveal that the bilayer response to the modulations in the interfacial interaction with its underlying substrate can be used as a sensitive tool to probe the integrity of SPBs upon exposure to NPs. As expected, anionic NPs tend to impart no significant damage to the anionic bilayers, whereas cationic NPs can be detrimental to bilayer integrity. This, is the first report of a QCM-D based method to probe bilayer integrity following exposure to NPs. Importantly, the degree of SPB interaction with its underlying substrate is shown to be a critical factor in the kinetics of bilayer disruption by cationic NPs, whereby weakly adhered bilayers are prone to, significantly faster breakup. Since free-floating cell membranes are better represented by a weakly adhered SPB, the results of this work critically influence paradigms in experimental studies involving SPBs as models for cell membranes.","3450":"Biodegradable polymers have become materials of hope for the future and knowledge on the relationships between their structure, properties and function is essential for prospective safe applications of such materials in the areas of human health and the environment. Examples are given of the uses of mass spectrometry (MS) for structural studies of biodegradable (co) polymers along with the use of multi-stage electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn). Specifically they concern applications of MS forthe characterization of natural biodegradable polymers and their derivatives, ESI-MSn in the synthesis of biodegradable copolyesters, MS for forensic engineering of advanced biodegradable polymeric materials as well as ESI-MSn for identification of selected biodegradable polymers on the way of molecular labelling.","2138":"We introduce a set of multicoordinating imidazole- and zwitterion-based ligands suited for surface functionalization of quantum dots (QDs). The polymeric ligands are built using a one-step nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and distinct amine-containing functionalities. This has allowed us to introduce several imidazole anchoring groups along the polymer chain for tight coordination to the QD surface and a controllable number of zwitterion moieties for water solubilization. It has also permitted the introduction of reactive and biomolecular groups for further conjugation and targeting. The QDs capped with these new ligands exhibit excellent long-term colloidal stability over a broad range of pH, toward excess electrolyte, in cell-growth media, and in the presence of natural reducing agents such as glutathione. These QDs are also resistant to the oxidizing agent H2O2. More importantly, by the use of zwitterion moieties as the hydrophilic block, this polymer design provides QDs with a thin coating and compact overall dimensions. These QDs are easily self-assembled with full size proteins expressed with a polyhistidine tag via metal histidine coordination. Additionally, the incorporation of amine groups allows covalent coupling of the QDs to the neurotransmitter dopamine. This yields redox-active QD platforms that can be used to track pH changes and detect Fe ions and cysteine through charge-transfer interactions. Finally, we found that QDs cap-exchanged with folic acid-functionalized ligands could effectively target cancer cells, where folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis of QDs into living cells was time- and concentration-dependent.","1317":"Organic electroactive materials derived from biomasses are promising candidates for next generation rechargeable batteries due to the low cost, sustainability and environmental benignity. Since organic materials have very low electronic conductivity, they are normally synthesized into nano-scale and mixed with conductive carbon before electrode fabrication. Herein, we first reported a unique role-to-role fabrication technology by taking advantage of the high solubility of organic materials in water. The synthetic process of nano-size organic materials is merged into the organic electrode fabrication process. 2,5-Dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone disodium salt (DHBQDS) is used as a model, and the DHBQDS nanorod electrode is in situ formed by precipitating DHBQDS nanorods from DHBQDS-sodium alginate-carbon black aqueous slurry film on a Cu current collector during electrode drying process. Due to the fast ionic and electronic conductivity of DHBQDS-carbon nanocomposite, the DHBQDS nanorod electrodes deliver a reversible capacity of 167 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 200 mA g(-1) after 300 cycles, which is 87% of its initial capacity (capacity decay rate of 0.051% per cycle). To reduce the dissolution of DHBQDS in the electrolyte upon cycling, a thin layer of Al2O3 with thickness of 1 nm or 2 nm is coated on the DHBQDS nanorod electrodes using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The Al2O3 coating remarkably suppresses the dissolution of DHBQDS nanorods as evidenced by the increased Coulombic efficiency from 94% to similar to 100% at a low current density of 50 mA g(-1). The reversible capacity of Al2O3 coated DHBQDS nanorod electrodes remains at 212 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles with a very low capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle. The ALD enhanced organic nanorods exhibit the best reversible capacity and cycle life among the organic electrodes reported for Na-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a nitrogen doped carbon foam (NCF) with both graphitized and porous carbon structure was fabricated by direct pyrolysis of melamine foam (MF) without using any transition metal catalyst. The graphitized carbon structure was possibly attributed to the triazine moieties in the MF precursor. The introduction of oxygen groups in the oxidation step resulted in the formation of large amount of micro- and mesopores and therefore high specific surface area. The NCF exhibited a three-dimensional cellular network consisting of carbon microfiber with abundant micro- and mesopores and giving rise to a specific surface area over 980 m(2) g(-1). Due to such graphitized porous structure, the NCF was demonstrated to have superior resilience, excellent electrocatalytic activity and good durability for oxygen reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The bubbles were transferred onto a hydrophobic substrate after drainage time of 0-20 min. Drainage time of 20 min is sufficient to generate fully drained bubbles. The structure of the transferred films was investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and metastable induced electron spectroscopy. Films transferred after a drainage time of 5 min or less show random orientation of the molecules in the films. Films transferred after a drainage time of 10 min or longer result in films forming a mixture of two different types of structures. The smaller fraction of the transferred film shows random orientation of the molecules. The larger fraction shows preferred orientation of the POPC molecules. In the fraction with preferred orientation the polar part of the POPC molecules forms to a large degree the outermost layer which is different to surfaces of surfactant solutions and to the surface of foam films formed by surfactant molecules. A surface formed by polar groups has a higher surface energy than a film formed by nonpolar groups. The possible reasons for the orientation of the molecules with the polar group pointing to the surface are discussed.","3337":"In this study, a novel conducting and soluble polyaniline salt prepared by chemical polymerization in the presence of a new doping agent (IAs) is proposed. This doping agent was prepared by the sulphonation of itaconic acid (IA) with concentrated sulphuric acid in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The obtained doped polyaniline (PANI-IAs) was extremely soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at room temperature, in which the solubility reached 44 mg mL(-1). The conductivity measurement of doped polyaniline powder precipitated in THF as dispersing medium gave a value of 0.13 S cm(-1) when the emeraldine base form of polyaniline was fully protonated.

Over the past 20-30 years, chemists have sought to replicate this strategy by developing new foldamers: oligomers that fold into well-defined secondary structures in solution. A wide array of abiotic foldamers have been developed,. ranging from. non-natural peptides to aromatics. The ortho-phenylenes represent a recent addition to the family of aromatic foldamers. Despite their structural simplicity (chains of benzenes connected at the ortho positions), it was not until 2010 that systematic studies of o-phenylenes showed that they reliably fold into helices in solution (and in the solid state). This conformational behavior is of fundamental interest: o-Arylene and o-heteroarylene structures are found embedded within many other systems, part of an emerging interest in sterically congested polyphenylenes. Further, o-phenylenes are increasingly straightforward to synthesize because of continuing developments in arene-arene coupling, the Asao-Yamamoto benzannulation, and benzyne polymerization. In this Account, we discuss the folding of o-phenylenes with emphasis on features that make them unique among aromatic foldamers. Interconversion between their different backbone conformers is slow on the NMR time scale around room temperature. The H-1 NMR spectra of oligomers can therefore be deconvoluted to give sets of chemical shifts for different folding states. The chemical shifts are both highly sensitive to conformation and readily predicted using ab initio methods, affording critical information about the conformational distribution. The picture that emerges is that o-phenylenes fold into helices with offset stacking between every third repeat unit. In general, misfolding occurs primarily at the oligomer termini (i.e., \"frayed ends\"). Because of their structural simplicity, the folding can be described by straightforward models. The overall population can be divided into two enantiomeric pools, with racemization and misfolding as two distinct processes. Examination of substituent effects on folding reveals that the determinant of the relative stability of different conformers is (offset) aromatic stacking interactions parallel to the helical axis. That is, the folding of ophenylenes is analogous to that of alpha-helices, with aromatic stacking in place of hydrogen bonding. The folding propensity can be tuned using well-known substituent effects on aromatic stacking, with moderate electron-withdrawing substituents giving nearly perfect folding. The combination of a simple folding mechanism and readily characterized conformational populations makes ophenylenes attractive structural motifs for incorporation into more-complex architectures, an important part of the next phase of foldamer research.","4988":"A three-dimensional (3D) carbonaceous aerogel derived from sustainable bacterial cellulose (BC) is introduced as a flexible framework for sulfur in lithium-sulfur batteries. The 3D carbonized BC (CBC) with highly interconnected nanofibrous structure exhibits good electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The intrinsic macroporous structure of CBC contributes to a high sulfur loading of 81 wt%. Microstructure and morphology characterization results demonstrate that the sulfur species wrapped around CBC nanofibers are well dispersed. Even at such a high loading, the S\/CBC composite still contains sufficient free space to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation. Furthermore, with an ultralight CBC interlayer inserted between the sulfur cathode and separator, significant improvement is achieved in active material utilization, cycling stability, and coulombic efficiency. The CBC interlayer can provide an extra conductive framework and adsorb migrating polysulfides to a certain degree. The CBC interlayer can also act as an additional collector for sulfur and thus could prevent the over-aggregation of insulated sulfur on the cathode surface. The good electrochemical performance reported in this work can be ascribed to the flexible 3D-interconnected nanostructure of the carbon framework and the rational design of battery configuration.","106":"Graphene wrapped nitrogen-doped active carbon fibers (ACF@GR) of a core-shell structure were successfully prepared by a simple dip-coating method using natural silk as template.

Moreover, the mechanism and relative susceptibility of three thymopoietin oligopeptides, thymocartin (TP4), thymopentin (TP5), and thymotrinan (TP3), to enzymatic degradation were investigated and compared at the molecular level. Initial investigations indicated that formation of the GCS-bestatin conjugate, with a substitution degree of 7.0% (moles of bestatin per mole of glycol glucosamine unit), could significantly protect all 3 peptides from aminopeptidase-mediated degradation in a concentration-dependent manner. The space hindrance and loss of one pair of hydrogen bonds, resulting from the covalent conjugation of chitosan with bestatin, did not affect the specific interaction between bestatin and aminopeptidase. Moreover, TP4 displayed a higher degradation clearance compared with those of TP5 and TP3 under the same experimental conditions. The varying levels of susceptibility of these 3 peptides to aminopeptidase (TP4 > TP5 > TP3) were closely related to differences in their binding energies to enzyme, which mainly involved Van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions, as supported by the results of molecular dynamics simulations. These results suggest that GCS-bestatin conjugate might be useful in the delivery of thymopoietin oligopeptides by mucosal routes, and that TP3 and TP5 are better alternatives to TP4 for delivery because of their robust resistance against enzymatic degradation.

SEM and HRTEM-EDS show that the magnetic graphene oxide nanoparticles were effectively dispersed on the cationic hydrogel matrix. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and effects of pH on AR88 uptake by MGO-CH were evaluated. The results show that MGO-CH achieves positive zeta potential values of 35.6-27.8 mV at pH 3.0-10.5, with a saturation magnetization of approximately 4.0 emu g(-1). The MGO-CH kinetics show a good fit with the pseudo-second order model. The maximum AR88 adsorption capacity of MGO-CH was 3476.7 mg g(-1) at an AR88 equilibrium concentration of 287.4 mg L-1 and pH = 7.0. Equilibrium adsorption data show that the Sips model is more suitable than the Langmuir and Freundlich models. MGO-CH exhibits an AR88 adsorption capacity of more than 1140.2 mg g(-1) in a strongly alkaline solution (pH > 10). The adsorption process is highly pH dependent, corresponding to electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and competitive adsorption interactions, and the optimal adsorption occurs at pH 3.0-5.8. The AR88 adsorption capacity of the regenerated MGO-CH approaches more than 95% of the fresh MGO-CH at a low initial concentration of 100 mg L-1 from the second to fifth recycles. As AR88 initial concentration increased up to 1500 mg L-1, the reusability of MGO-CH was decreased from the first to third cycle and was maintained stably afterwards. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that C-O and C=O functional groups contribute to AR88 adsorption. This finding was also confirmed by C 1s spectra from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The deconvolution of the N 1s spectra before and after AR88 adsorption indicates that the quaternary ammonium group of the cationic hydrogel contributes to AR88 removal.","5374":"In this work, we adopt a quantum mechanical approach based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study the optical and electronic properties of alizarin supported on TiO 2 nano-crystallites, as a prototypical dye-sensitized solar cell. To ensure proper alignment of the donor (alizarin) and acceptor (TiO 2 nano-crystallite) levels, static optical excitation spectra are simulated using time-dependent density functional theory in response. The ultrafast photoelectron transfer from the dye to the cluster is simulated using an explicitly time-dependent, one-electron TDDFT ansatz. The model considers the -pulse excitation of a single active electron localized in the dye to the complete set of energetically accessible, delocalized molecular orbitals of the dye\/nano-crystallite complex. A set of quantum mechanical tools derived from the transition electronic flux density is introduced to visualize and analyze the process in real time. The evolution of the created wave packet subject to absorbing boundary conditions at the borders of the cluster reveal that, while the electrons of the aromatic rings of alizarin are heavily involved in an ultrafast charge redistribution between the carbonyl groups of the dye molecule, they do not contribute positively to the electron injection and, overall, they delay the process.","6508":"Heteroatom doped graphene-based materials generally offer great advantages towards constructing advanced catalysts. In this work, we develop a novel sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) co-doped graphene-like nanobubble and nanosheet hybridized architecture prepared by a cost-efficient strategy using keratin containing abundant N and S sources as the precursor and KOH as the activating agent. After further graphitization and ammonia treatments at 1000 degrees C, it displays an ultrahigh surface area (1799 m(2) g(-1)) as well as abundant active heteroatom dopants (graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and thiophene-S). Electrochemical measurements show that its onset potential is nearly 26 mV positive than that of the commercial Pt\/C catalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, and it has higher electrochemical stability and fuel tolerance than Pt\/C. To the best of our knowledge, such ORR activity is the best one among the metal-free graphene-based catalysts in alkaline media, and much higher than that of the other reported biomass-derived carbon-based catalysts. Significantly, when employed as the air electrode for zinc-air batteries, this graphene-like hybrid catalyst displays an outstanding performance compared to the Pt\/C catalyst. Moreover, compared with Pt\/C, such a catalyst also exhibits comparable ORR activity and higher stability in acidic media. The outstanding ORR performance can be mainly attributed to its novel hybridized graphene-like architecture, which endows it with a similar thin layered property to graphene and an ultrahigh surface area as well as excellent hierarchical porous structures, and to the synergistic effect of the appropriate graphitization degree and high content of active heteroatoms.","1729":"Highly flexible nanocomposites have tremendous potential as smart, self-sensing materials because their conductivity is inherently linked to their mechanical state.

Load testing of the bonded sensor reveals that viscoelasticity and filler volume fraction profoundly affect the piezoresistive response. EIT is able to accurately capture and discern between multiple points of contact in each volume fraction with lower volume fractions being more sensitive thereby demonstrating the potential of utilizing tomographic methods for tactile imaging and distributed strain sensing in PU-based nanocomposites.

A simple and effective method is presented for the separation and preconcentration of U(VI)] and Thorium Th(IV) by solid phase extraction on synthesized modified polymeric chelating resin. The synthesized chelating polymeric sorbent showed superior binding affinity towards U(VI) and Th(IV) under selective pH conditions. The optimum pH range was established and the flow rates for U(VI) and Th(IV) were studied respectively. U(VI) and Th(IV) are quantitatively eluted with suitable eluants like HCl and HNO3 and determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Other parameters such as total sorption capacity, exchange kinetics, preconcentration factor, distribution coefficient, breakthrough capacity and resin stability. The uptake and stripping of these metal ions on the resin were fast, indicating a better accessibility of the metal ions towards the chelating sites. Chromatographic separation of Th(IV) and U(VI) was accomplished by adjustment of pH in the range of 3.0-9.0 pH, respectively. Separation of Th(IV) and U(VI) from other metal cations, in synthetic solution was achieved. The synthesized resins were recycled at least 14-16 times without much affecting column sorption capacity.","4441":"Proper disposal of waste paper is an important waste-management concern. We developed a facile and inexpensive method to transform waste paper into graphene-tethered carbon fiber composite paper (GCCP). Urea was the only additive for the carbonization of the GCCP. The as-obtained GCCP exhibited high electrical conductivity, and GCCP\/polydimethyl siloxane (GCCP\/PDMS) composites showed good stretchability with great electromechanical stability. The surface of the GCCP membrane was observed to be superhydrophobic; this property apparently endowed the membrane with the ability to separate oil from water in our experiments, which makes GCCP a promising candidate material for cleanup of oil spills. The hierarchical structure, N doping feature and low decoration with Pt make GCCP a potential electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions with superior activity and high stability, and hence also a promising candidate for application as a direct working electrode in future energy systems.","2683":"The increasing demand for multifunctional polymer nanocomposites calls for new technologies to simultaneously enhance mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. This paper presents the use of an alternating-current electric field to align graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) in an epoxy polymer. Theoretical modeling of the alignment process has identified the key parameters that control the rotation and chain-formation of the GnPs. Experimental results reveal that the resulting nanocomposites exhibit anisotropic properties with significantly improved electrical and thermal conductivities in the alignment direction, and dramatically increased fracture toughness when the GnPs are aligned transverse to the crack growth direction. In particular, compared to the unmodified epoxy polymer, the alignment of the GnPs yields up to about 7-8 orders of magnitude improvement in the electrical conductivity, up to approximately 60% increase in the thermal conductivity, and up to a nearly 900% increase in the mode I fracture toughness. The dramatic improvement in the fracture toughness is attributed to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms including microcracking, pinning, deflection and branching of the crack, and rupture and pull-out of the GnPs. Such major improvement in the toughness arises from GnPs being transversely aligned to the crack growth direction exhibiting increased interactions with the advancing crack tip. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Bi2Ti2O7 nanosheets were grown on the surface of TiO2 submicron fibers. The density of the nanosheets increased with higher precursor concentration of the Bi\/Ti reaction raw materials. UV-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy indicated that the absorption spectrum of the Bi2Ti2O7\/TiO2 composite extended into the visible-light region. Photocatalytic tests showed that the Bi2Ti2O7\/TiO2 heterostructures possess a much higher degradation rate of rhodamine B than the unmodified TiO2 submicron fibers under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect between improved visible-light absorption and the internal electric field created by the heterojunctions. The effective separation of photogenerated carriers driven by the photoinduced potential was demonstrated by the photoelectrochemical analysis.","2476":"A simple and innovative process is described for the ecofriendly preparation of ceria foams via carboxymethylcellulose gelation by Ce4+ cations; heat treatment of the ensuing xerogels produces ceria foams. The influence of the concentration of cerium and of the calcination temperature of the xerogels is studied. Several characterization methods have been used and the obtained results demonstrate that this technique allows the controlled growth of ceria foams. The foamy structure apparently is responsible for UV absorption, and the ceria foam is basic enough to promote the epoxidation of chalcone; comparison of the catalytic activity of the ceria foam versus ceria prepared via a coprecipitation method shows that the ceria foam is most active as it promotes epoxidation of electron-deficient alkenes with dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide.","1383":"Crosslinked poly(ST-co-DVB-co-NaSS) latex nanoparticles (LNPs) with average particle size were used as template to prepare porous carbonized electrospun nanofibers (CENFs) with pore size about 10 nm on the surface and inside by electrospinning and carbonization. The porous CENFs without and with MWCNTs exhibited high specific surface area of 505 and 535 m(2)\/g and high mesoporosity percentage of 80% and 84% respectively. The porous CENFs as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors in 1 M H2SO4 showed a specific capacitance of 235 F\/g while the addition of MWCNTs led to an increase to 262 Fig. These free-standing and binder-free mesoporous CENFs with outstanding capacitance could be good candidates as electrode materials for supercapacitors.

Both NFC suspensions showed a complex rheology, which was typical of yield stress, non-linear and thixotropic fluids. Hysteresis loops and erratic evolutions of the macroscale shear stress were also observed, thereby suggesting important mesostructural changes and\/or inhomogeneous flow conditions. The in situ optical observations revealed drastic mesostructural changes for the enzymatic NFC suspensions, whereas the TEMPO NFC suspensions did not exhibit mesoscale heterogeneities. However, for both suspensions, USV measurements showed that the flow was heterogeneous and exhibited complex situations with the coexistence of multiple flow bands, wall slippage and possibly multidimensional effects. Using USV measurements, we also showed that the fluidization of these suspensions could presumably be attributed to a progressive and spatially heterogeneous transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like behavior. As the shear rate was increased, the multiple coexisting shear bands progressively enlarged and nearly completely spanned over the rheometer gap, whereas the plug-like flow bands were eroded.","2115":"Si3N4 particle reinforced silica aerogel composites have been fabricated by the sol-gel method via ambient pressure drying. The microstructure and mechanical, thermal insulation and dielectric properties of the composites were investigated. The effect of the Si3N4 content on the microstructure and properties were also clarified. The results indicate that the obtained mesoporous composites exhibit low thermal conductivity (0,024-0.072 Wm(-1) K-1), low dielectric constant (1.55-1.85) and low loss tangent (0.005-0.007). As the Si3N4 content increased from 5 to 20 vol.%, the compressive strength and the flexural strength of the composites increased from 3.21 to 12.05 MPa and from 0.36 to 2.45 MPa, respectively. The obtained composites exhibit considerable promise in wave transparency and thermal insulation functional integration applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanoparticle-based vehicles for drug delivery serves as an ideal technology, however, utilization of them remains controversial due to potential safety concerns and transient drug retention. Nanodiamonds (NDs), with excellent biocompatibility and diversity of potential conjugates, have emerged as alternative promising materials in this regard.

MYR has been proven to be an effective anticancer agent against glioblastoma cells in our previous studies. However, the poor solubility of MYR limits its access to the brain. In this study, the feasibility of preparing lipid-based MM that combined sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) with Pluronic F68 (F68) and Labrasol was investigated. Furthermore, the nonionic surfactant coating technology for the protection of MYR against oxidation, and its attainment in oral bioavailability, was examined. On account of the altered biomaterial properties of F68\/SDS-modified lipid-based micelles, myricetin-loaded mixed micelles (MYR-MMs) were prepared by solvent-vaporation method to self-assembly into MMs. The average size of MYR-MMs was 96.3 nm, with negatively charged potential and spherical in shape. The drug loading of MYR-MMs was high with the increased grafting ratio, the more prolonged drug release profile, and more effective killing glioblastoma cells in vitro. Moreover, MYR-MMs showed a higher preference for the brain than free MYR alone, suggesting the novel MMs loaded with MYR could promote absorption and increase relative bioavailability. Taken together, the F68\/SDS-modified and Labrasol-modified lipid-based micelles may provide a promising method to deliver polyphenolic compounds across the brain to treat brain tumor.

However, serious interlayer stacking exists in MXene particles, which greatly decreases the electrical conductivity in the bulk and hinders the accessibility of interlayers to electrolyte ions. Thus, multi-stacked MXene particles exhibit low capacitance and poor rate capability. Herein, we report an effective strategy to directly improve the electrochemical performance of multi-stacked MXene (Ti3C2Tx) particles as LIB anode materials. It was successfully realized by growing conductive \"carbon nanofiber (CNF) bridges\" within the gaps of each Ti3C2Tx particle as well as the outside. With the help of these CNFs, the as-prepared Ti3C2\/CNF particles exhibited significantly improved reversible capacity compared with pure Ti3C2Tx particles. More remarkably, even at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C, the capacity of Ti3C2\/CNF hybrid particles was just slightly lower than that of pure Ti3C2Tx particles at 1 C, and there was no capacity decay after 2900 cycles at 100 C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and superior long-term stability at the ultrahigh rate.","2223":"Ionic liquidswhich are special solvents composed entirely of ionsare difficult albeit interesting to study for several reasons. Owing to the many possible cation and anion combinations that form ionic liquids, common properties are hard to classify for them, which makes the theoretical investigation crucial for ionic liquids. The system size, the amount of possible isomers including cation-anion orientation and coordination, as well as the rotation of the side chain(s) prevent the use of high-level electronic structure methods, and density functional theory is the method of choice. Dispersion forcesalthough they are small compared to electrostaticsplay a major role in ionic liquids; therefore, methods that describe such kind of interplay are preferred. Between the cation and the anion, there is a sizable charge transfer, which has important consequences for molecular dynamics simulations and force field development. Already based on the first generation of force fields important discoveries were made, namely that ionic liquids are nanostructured. Moreover, it was possible to predict that their distillation is possible. Throughout the construction of these force fields, transferability was taken into account which allowed them to describe homologous series. For studying reactions in ionic liquid (IL) media, continuum models were found to improve the results. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and quantum mechanics (QM)\/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches are well suited for spontaneous events. In case of very large systems, such as cellulose in ionic liquids, coarse-grained methods are providing insight and are applied more frequently. This makes ionic liquids real multiscalar systems.

The magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles used in this study were synthesized using a conventional co-precipitation method. The systematic characterisation of the magnetic alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers was done using FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD and SEM. The prepared magnetic alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers showed ferromagnetic behaviour when studied with the help of a vibrating sample magnetometer and can be easily separated using a strong magnet. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile strength measurements reported an improvement in the thermostability and mechanical properties of the prepared magnetic alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers when compared to the blank alginate hydrogel fibers. All of these property enhancements in the alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers are suggestive of good compatibility and effective interactions between the alginate polymer matrix and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Also, the magnetic alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers were interestingly found to be very effective in the adsorption of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, while the blank alginate hydrogel fiber did not show any significant adsorption. Therefore, such magnetic alginate-Fe3O4 hydrogel fibers can work as a simple and cost-effective probe for the successful adsorption\/separation of antibiotics, with the additional advantages of being easy to fabricate and having high thermal stability and mechanical strength.","167":"The environmental processes of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been widely investigated in the literature where the importance of natural organic matter (NOM) was often highlighted. This review thoroughly summarized the emerging efforts in understanding interactions between MNPs and NOM. The main environmental processes influenced by NOM are adsorption, stabilization\/aggregation, dissolution and surface transformation. Adsorption, competition and desorption irreversibility of NOM on the MNP surface were discussed with regard to NOM properties. For soluble MNPs, their dissolution was generally promoted after interacting with NOM although dissolution suppression was also reported. Besides dissolution, two main surface transformation processes including oxidation and sulfidation can occur on the MNP surface in the presence of NOM. The relationship between NOM-induced dispersion and other processes such as adsorption, dissolution and surface transformation was discussed. Due to the alteration of the above environmental processes, NOM can have an impact on the toxicity of MNPs on aquatic organisms. Therefore, the toxicity of MNPs in the presence of different types of NOM was addressed. It is concluded that NOM can alter MNP toxicity through changing suspension stabilization of MNPs, bioavailability of metal ions dissolved from MNPs, electrostatic interactions and steric repulsion between MNPs and organisms, and MNP-induced reactive oxygen species generation. However, the impact of MNP transformation induced by NOM on toxicity needs further investigations. Moreover, mesocosm studies and mathematical models are suggested to examine the environmental processes of MNPs in the presence of NOM in large-scale aquatic systems. Several key research challenges are provided at the end of this review.","1005":"Composite carbon nanofibers (CNFs) containing bioglass (BG) nanoparticles displayed different morphology and microstructures depending on the sintering temperature (800, 1000 and 1200 degrees C) when they were produced from an electrospun polyacrylonitrile-BG precursor blend nanofibers. Biomineralization using simulated body fluid (SBF) and biological evaluation using an osteoblast culture were performed to investigate their relationship with sintering temperature. Characterization revealed that the BG nanoparticles on CNF\/BG sintered at 1000 degrees C (CNF\/BG-1000) possessed small particle size and uniform size distribution, and the crystallinity of the BG nanoparticles increased as the sintering temperature was increased from 800 to 1200 degrees C. The dissolution rate of the BG nanoparticles was thus different between the cases, which enhanced the biomineralization and cell proliferation\/differentiation to varying degrees. Benefiting from the homogeneous distribution and large specific surface area of the BG nanoparticles on the CNFs, the results demonstrated that CNF\/BG-1000 had the strongest ability in promoting apatite deposition, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts in comparison with CNF\/BG sintered at 800 or 1200 degrees C. The results demonstrate a flexible tool to regulate the physiochemical and biological properties of CNF\/BG composites by controlling the sintering temperature, which could find promising applications in skeleton repairing.","2973":"The thermally allowed electrocyclic reaction syncyclophanediene (CPD) to dihydropyrene (DHP) was compared with the disallowed thermal electrocyclic reaction in anti CPD through density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP\/6-31 + G(d) level. Moreover, the results were also compared with the electrocyclization of 1,3,5 hexatriene to 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The Woodwar-Hoffmann (W-H) allowed thermal reaction in syn CPD 11 has a calculated activation barrier of 6.23 kcal mol(-1), compared with 29 kcal mol(-1) for the electrocyclization of 1,3,5 hexatriene to 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The enhanced acceleration of electrocyclization is believed to arise from geometrically enforced spatially aligned termini of the hexatriene. Substituents at the electrocyclic terminus of cyclophanediene significantly affected (up to three fold) the activation barriers. Mono-substitution of CPD has substituent dependent acceleration or deceleration whereas di-substitution always increased the activation barrier. The activation barrier for electrocyclization in 33 is 4.44 kcal mol(-1), which is the lowest activation barrier for any thermal electrocyclic reaction. Cyclophanedienes (CPDs) substituted with electron-rich substituents cyclized with high activation barriers and vice versa, a phenomenon significantly different from electrocyclic reaction of 1,3,5-hexatriene where no such trend is traceable. Comparison of W-H allowed and forbidden electrocyclization in syn and anti CPDs, respectively, revealed quite similar electronic demand, although the transition states are different in nature. The transition state for a W-H forbidden reaction is biradicaloid, with most of the spin density at the electrocyclic termini; however, the transition state for a W-H allowed reaction has no such contribution. We also believe that this is the first study of its type, where W-H allowed and forbidden reactions are compared on a similar set of molecules, and compared for electronic effect through substituents.","3542":"Nanoparticle interacts with live cells depending on their surface chemistry, enters into cell via endocytosis, and is commonly trafficked to an endosome\/lysozome that restricts subcellular targeting options. Here we show that nanoparticle surface chemistry can be tuned to alter their cell uptake mechanism and subcellular trafficking. Quantum dot based nanoprobes of 20-30 nm hydrodynamic diameters have been synthesized with tunable surface charge (between +15 mV to -25 mV) and lipophilicity to influence their cellular uptake processes and subcellular trafficking. It is observed that cationic nanoprobe electrostatically interacts with cell membrane and enters into cell via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. At lower surface charge (between +10 mV to -10 mV), the electrostatic interaction with cell membrane becomes weaker, and additional lipid raft endocytosis is initiated. If a lipophilic functional group is introduced on a weakly anionic nanoparticle surface, the uptake mechanism shifts to predominant lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. In particular, the zwitterionic-lipophilic nanoprobe has the unique advantage as it weakly interacts with anionic cell membrane, migrates toward lipid rafts for interaction through lipophilic functional group, and induces lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. While predominate or partial clathrin-mediated entry traffics most of the nanoprobes to lysozome, predominate lipid raft-mediated entry traffics them to perinuclear region, particularly to the Golgi apparatus. This finding would guide in designing appropriate nanoprobe for subcellular targeting and delivery.","2847":"A Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C nanocomposite is successfully synthesized by a simple pre-reduction and subsequent calcination process. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C nanocomposite are investigated. The Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 106 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 20 mA g(-1), equivalent to reversible storage of 1.8 Na per unit of Na3V2(PO4)(3). The electrode also exhibited excellent rate capability, as it could release 92 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1), 77mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1), and 47 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1). The preliminary experimental results suggest that this Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C nanocomposite is a promising cathode material for low-cost and high-performance Na ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show how the DLC layer acts as an additional carbon source during the pre-annealing stage and changes the nanofiber morphology significantly compared to the case without the DLC layer. Significant amount of carbon is dissolved into the Ni layer during the pre-annealing stage, which leads to supersaturation and subsequent precipitation of carbon out of the Ni particles during the growth stage.

Upon addition of Zn(II) ions to selected wells, the fluorescence of the gel was observed to increase in a concentration dependent manner in the 0.25-1.75 mM range. The millimolar binding constant observed for this probe is higher than that reported for other Zn(II) probes in the literature and offers the possibility to determine the concentration of this ion in environments where the Zn(II) concentration is high. The combination of the multi-well plate set-up with fluorescence detection offers the possibility of high-throughput screening using low sample volumes in a timely manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported example of a polymeric hydrogel sensor for zinc with capability for use in fluorescence multi-well plate assay.","927":"A C@Fe3O4 core-shell nanofiber bundle (C@Fe3O4NFB) was easily prepared using a natural collagen fiber (CF) as the biotemplate and carbon source. The as-prepared C@Fe3O4NFB features a continuous conductive pathway with dramatically accelerated electron and Li+ transport kinetics, thus exhibiting an ultrahigh-rate capability. Furthermore, the C@Fe3O4 core-shell structure is able to suppress the electrode pulverization due to the existence of the carbon nanofiber as an elastic buffering matrix, thus delivering long-term cycling stability. Based on electrochemical experiments, C@Fe3O4NFB delivered capacities of 839, 668, 422 and 301 mA h g(-1) at current densities of 0.2, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g(-1), respectively. At the current density of 1.0 A g(-1), the reversible capacity of C@Fe3O4NFB is as high as 632 mA h g(-1) in the 500th cycle, which accounts for 84.38% capacity of the 2nd cycle, suggesting a low capacity loss of 0.23 mA h g(-1) per cycle. Even after 2000 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1), the discharge capacity still reaches 354 mA h g(-1). This biotemplated synthesis approach provides a novel and interesting route for fabricating ultrahigh-rate anode materials of LIBs.","6724":"A nitrogen-doped activated carbon (NDAC) as a cathode catalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) was synthesized by a microwave-assisted method using ammonium carbonate as a nitrogen source. The prepared NDAC showed a higher BET surface area of up to 1717.8 m(2) g(-1) and a total pore volume of 0.79 cm(3) g(-1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that N was successfully doped on the surface of AC in three species, corresponding to pyrrolic N, pyridinic N and pyridine-N-oxide. Compared with untreated AC, the NDAC exhibited better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in rotating disk electrode tests, with a current density of 12.4 mA cm(-2) at a set potential of -0.8 V (vs. SCE) (AC, 11.3 mA cm(-2)) and an electron transfer number of 3.14 (AC, n = 2.83). MFCs equipped with a NDAC cathode achieved a higher maximum power density of 471 +\/- 11 mW cm(-2) when fed with domestic wastewater, which was 1.3 times higher than that of the AC cathode. It also displayed long-term operation stability when dealing with real wastewater, indicating a promising cathode catalyst for MFCs towards practical applications.","6637":"We reviewed numerical\/analytical models for describing rheological properties and mechanical behaviors of biopolymer networks with a focus on the cytoskeleton, a major component of a living cell. The cytoskeleton models are classified into three categories: the cell-scale continuum-based model, the structure-based model, and the polymerbased model, according to the length scales of the phenomena of interest. The criteria for classification of the models are modified and extended from those used by Mofrad [M. R. K. Mofrad, Annual Rev. Fluid Mech. 41, 433 (2009)]. The main principles and characteristics of each model are summarized and discussed by comparison with each other. Since the stress-deformation relation of cytoskeleton is dependent on the length scale of stress elements, our model classification helps systematic understanding of biopolymer network modeling.","6957":"Transition-metal-containing hydrotalcites (HTc) and V(acac)(3)\/Cu(NO3)(2)3H(2)O (acac=acetylacetonate)mixtures were tested for their catalytic activity in the cleavage of the lignin model compound erythro-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-l,3-propanediol (1) with molecular oxygen as oxidant. Both catalytic systems displayed high activity and good selectivity and afforded veratric acid as the main product. The catalyst behavior was studied by EPR spectroscopy, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. After the catalysts were established for the model system, lignin depolymerization studies were performed with various organsolv and kraft lignin sources. The oxidative depolymerization and lignin bond cleavage were monitored by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), MALDI MS, and 2D-NMR (HSQC). Irrespective of the lignin pretreatment, both HTc-Cu-V and V(acac)(3)\/Cu(NO3)(2)3H(2)O were able to cleave the -O-4 linkages and the resinol structures to form dimeric and trimeric products.","1501":"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem worldwide. Because current anti-HBV treatments are only virostatic, there is an urgent need for development of alternative antiviral approaches. In this context, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and cationic polymers, such as chitosan (CS), appear of particular interest as nonviral vectors due to their capacity to facilitate cellular delivery of bioactive cargoes including peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) or DNA vaccines. We have investigated the ability of a PNA conjugated to different CPPs to inhibit the replication of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), a reference model for human HBV infection. The in vivo administration of PNA-CPP conjugates to neonatal ducklings showed that they reached the liver and inhibited DHBV replication. Interestingly, our results indicated also that a modified CPP (CatLip) alone, in the absence of its PNA cargo, was able to drastically inhibit late stages of DHBV replication. In the mouse model, conjugation of HBV DNA vaccine to modified CS (Man-CS-Phe) improved cellular and humoral responses to plasmid-encoded antigen. Moreover, other systems for gene delivery were investigated including CPP-modified CS and cationic nanoparticles. The results showed that these nonviral vectors considerably increased plasmid DNA uptake and expression. Collectively promising results obtained in preclinical studies suggest the usefulness of these safe delivery systems for the development of novel therapeutics against chronic hepatitis B.","2284":"Thin film of biopolymeric compound chitosan (CTS) has been surfaced on moderately doped n-InP substrate as an interfacial layer by means of spin coating for the electronic modification of Au\/n-InP structure. Electrical characterization of Au\/CTS\/n-InP hybrid junction has been performed by I-V and C-V measurements at room temperature. An effective barrier height (BH) value of 0.678eV and an ideality factor of n=1.665 have been obtained for the hybrid junction. The CTS interfacial layer has been found to reduce the reverse bias leakage current of the junction by about three orders of magnitude and enhance the BH by about 0.213eV. Furthermore, the BH value of the hybrid junction has been obtained as 0.693eV by C-V measurement. Good performance of the device could be ascribed to the passivation effect of the CTS interfacial layer between Au and n-InP. The BH values of 0.678 and 0.693eV for the hybrid junction have been significantly higher than that of the conventional Au\/n-InP junction (similar to 0.465eV). The results indicated that biopolymeric thin interfacial CTS layer might lead to the modification of the potential barrier for metal\/n-InP junctions. Moreover, band gap of the CTS layer has been determined as 4.60eV via UV-vis spectroscopy.","1144":"The design and development of Janus suprabeads (JSs) With multiple responses are highly desirable in the fabrication of functional nanomaterials, In this work, we report a triphase microfluidic strategy for the construction of JSs with temperature-magnetism-optics triple responses. Initially, macromonomer poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) obtained Via catalytic chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) was grafted onto the polystyrene (PS) colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs) surface. Because abundant carboxylic acid groups in PMAA could coordinate cadmium ions for in situ production of fluorescent CdS quantum dots (QDs) after introducing sulfur ions, the as-prepared JSs were endowed with favorable optical properties. Meanwhile, the as-prepared Cd2+\/PS CPCs were employed as a template to build JSs with temperature-magnetism sensitivity via the introduction of magnetic Fe3O4 and hydrogels. Finally, the fluorescence pattern was easily performed by using chalcogenides as \"ink\" to write on the pad) in which in situ reaction mechanism was involved in the response. The multiple responsive JSs show promising applications in sensor, display, and anticounterfeit fields.","6531":"Graphene oxide (GO) based two dimensional (2D) nanosheets show great advantages for constructing nacre-like composites. Among the existing nacre structures, GO sheets were mostly used as hard inorganic components as those in nacre to improve the mechanical properties. Here, a novel nanoconfined electrodeposition process was explored to fabricate nacre-like Cu2O\/graphene oxide (GO) thin films, where GO nanosheets functioned as the soft organic components in nacre. The inter-layer spaces between the GO nanosheets were used as templates for the growth of single crystalline Cu2O nanolayers, with thicknesses of several to tens of nanometers, though Cu2O belongs to the cubic phase. Due to the small lattice mismatch between the (1 (1) over bar0) plane of Cu2O and the (001) plane of GO, the Cu2O nanolayers most likely grew on the (001) plane of GO. The resulting nacre-like thin film demonstrates a 6 times greater hardness and a 3 times greater Young's modulus, than those of pure GO thin films. This technique provides a promising route for the synthesis of nacre-like metal (metal-oxide)\/GO composites.","4350":"A sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for detection of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) was developed by using PtAu nanoparticles loaded on TiO2 colloidal spheres (PtAu\/TiO2) as secondary-antibody (Ab(2)) labels. In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (N-GS) and chitosan (CS) were applied to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. Then the SCCA primary antibody (Ab(1)), SCCA and PtAu\/TiO2-Ab(2) were sequentially modified onto the electrode surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to characterize the preparation process of the immunosensor and the amperometric response of the immunosensor for catalyzing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction was also recorded. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide linear response to SCCA ranging from 0.001 ng mL(-1) to 15 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 0.3 pg mL(-1). The proposed immunosensor displayed good reproducibility, high sensitivity, and acceptable stability. Therefore, this method has potential application for clinical immunoassays of other biomolecules.","2189":"Volume diffractive optical elements promise widespread application in laser beam shaping, imaging and optical data storage by structuring refractive index modulation in the third axial dimension. Femtosecond laser direct writing has been exploited inside fused silica to assemble multiple 1D grating layers on Talbot planes and overcome the inherent weak diffraction efficiency otherwise found in low-contrast volume gratings. Here, we extend laser structuring from linear (1D) to orthogonally crossed (2D) gratings with the aim to write 3D photonic crystal templates in photoresist by 3D interference lithography. The formation of crossed grating structures present challenges in balancing the efficiency of diffraction orders owing to blazing and index overwriting effects requiring compensation by tuning the grating design and laser power exposure. In this way, six-layer grating designs have been fabricated and applied to exposure of thick photoresist, enabling the formation of 3D photonic crystal templates with bicontinuous structure. A systematic offsetting of orthogonal grating layers to establish phase offsets over 0 to pi\/2 range presents a precise means for controlling the photonic crystal structure symmetry between body centered tetragonal (BCT) and woodpilelike tetragonal (wTTR).

A variety of techniques have been developed to prepare microbubbles, such as ultrasonication, excimer laser ablation, high shear emulsification, membrane emulsification, an inkjet printing method, electrohydrodynamic atomization, template layer-by-layer deposition, and microfluidics. Generated bubbles should be immediately stabilized via the adsorption of stabilizing materials (e.g., surfactants, lipids, proteins, and solid particles) onto the gas-liquid interface to lower the interfacial tension. Such adsorption of stabilizers prevents coalescence between the microbubbles and also suppresses gas dissolution and resulting disproportionation caused by the presence of the Laplace overpressure across the gas-liquid interface. Herein, we comprehensively review three important topics of microbubbles: stabilization, fabrication, and applications.","1412":"Self-propelled zirconia-graphene\/Pt hybrid tubular micromotors, prepared by electrochemical template synthesis, are used for both high-affinity capture and isolation of nerve agents. The simultaneous electrochemical deposition of zirconia and reduced graphene oxide leads to high surface area with a needle-like zirconia microstructure. The attractive surface properties of graphene sheets are used as growth directing template for the electrochemical synthesis of high surface area of zirconia nanostructures for effective and selective binding of organophosphate compounds. Such selective binding is dramatically enhanced by the rapid movement of the motors and the corresponding bubble-induced solution mixing. The greatly increased fluid transport leads to a 15-fold faster remediation compared to the use of the static counterpart structures. The unique material properties allow the convenient alkaline regeneration of the micromotor surface, improving the cost effectiveness of this methodology. The new strategy provides an opportunity to develop reusable micromotors for high-affinity capture-based separation of nerve agents and can be extended to verification analysis of chemical weapon convention. Such coupling of advanced surface materials with rapidly moving micromotors holds considerable promise for diverse defense and sustainable environmental applications.","4927":"Combined with quantum calculations and mesoscale simulations, the self-assembly of twelve lipid-structured PEO-b-PMMA copolymers (BCPs) with six types of molecular topologies was investigated. The BCPs with MMA species as the connecting center of the other arms present ample mesoscale structures, such as micelles and lamellae or curved lamellar phases, and even macrophase separation occurs for the long-chained BCPs. The excluded volume effect of confinements helps form vesicle-like structures, which proved to be a possible method of confinement to regulate phase morphologies or segment distributions and, ultimately, the properties of materials. An analysis of the phase formation process of short-chained BCP with two hydrophilic EO segments and one hydrophobic MMA segment indicated that four stages were found in both neutral and non-neutral wall confinement, all of which present a hexagonal columnar phase. Surprisingly, when the repulsion effect of the wall to the EO segment is greater than that of the MMA segment, such BCP self assembles into a crossed columnar phase, and the intersection angle of the orientation of these two sets of cylinder arrays is 75 degrees, which can be used to produce heterogeneous nanotube arrays. For the short-chained BCP with four arms joined at MMA species and EO segments in the outer region, we found a novel method of exchanging the repulsive preference of the wall to the EO or MMA species that can control the adsorption or desorption of the lamellar phase with the interval of EO or MMA segments.","7093":"A uniformly coated MoS2\/carbon-nanocomposite with a three-dimensional hierarchical architecture based on carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) nanofibers is synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing at 700 degrees C in an Ar atmosphere. Strong hydrogen bonds between the Mo precursor and the BC nanofibers are found to be crucial for the in situ growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the nanofibers during the hydrothermal process. The fibrous structure was maintained and the connection between MoS2 and the nanofibers were strengthened in the sintering process, leading to an improved stability of the resulting nanocomposite upon electrochemical cycling. The low-cost and environmentally friendly 3D web-like structure enables binder-free and carbon-free electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, which exhibit high specific discharge capacities up to 1140 mA h g(-1) at the C-rate of 1C without significant capacity fading for over 50 cycles. The porous conductive hierarchical structure of the composite endows excellent rate performance by avoiding the aggregation of the MoS2 nanosheets and by accommodating mechanical stress which appears upon electrochemical cycling.","2229":"To commercialize fuel cells and metal-air batteries, cost-effective, highly active catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) must be developed. Herein, we describe the development of low-cost, heteroatom (N, P, Fe) ternary-doped, porous carbons (HDPC). These materials are prepared by one-step pyrolysis of natural tea leaves treated with an iron salt, without any chemical and physical activation. The natural structure of the tea leaves provide a 3D hierarchical porous structure after carbonization. Moreover, heteroatom containing organic compounds in tea leaves act as precursors to functionalize the resultant carbon frameworks. In addition, we found that the polyphenols present in tea leaves act as ligands, reacting with Fe ions to form coordination compounds; these complexes acted as the precursors for Fe and N active sites. After pyrolysis, the as-prepared HDPC electrocatalysts, especially HDPC-800 (pyrolyzed at 800 A degrees C), had more positive onsets, half-wave potentials, and higher catalytic activities for the ORR, which proceeds via a direct four-electron reaction pathway in alkaline media, similar to commercial Pt\/C catalysts. Furthermore, HDPC-X also showed enhanced durability and better tolerance to methanol crossover and CO poisoning effects in comparison to commercial Pt\/C, making them promising alternatives for state-of-the-art ORR electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. The method used here provides valuable guidelines for the design of high-performance ORR electrocatalysts from natural sources at the industrial scale.","2515":"The development of advanced energy storage systems is of crucial importance to meet the ever-growing demands of electric vehicles, portable devices, and renewable energy harvest. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, with the advantages in its high specific energy density, low cost of raw materials, and environmental benignity, are of great potential to serve as next-generation batteries. However, there are many obstacles towards the practical application of Li-S batteries such as the electrical insulating nature of sulfur, the volume expansion during lithium insertion, and the shuttle of soluble polysulfide intermediates that induces severe degradation of the cell performance. In this review, the progresses of multifunctional separators\/interlayers in Li-S batteries are highlighted. The introduction of multi-functional separators\/interlayers with unexpected multiple functionalities is beneficial for better sulfur utilization, efficient polysulfide diffusion inhibition, and anode protection. Multi-functional separator system with ion selective\/electrical conductive polymer, sp(2) and porous carbon, metal oxide modified separators, as well as interlinked free-standing nanocarbon, micro\/mesoporous carbon, and other conductive inter layers have been proposed. The biomass derived materials was also included as interlayer for advanced Li-S batteries. These novel Li-S cell configurations with multi-functional separators\/interlayers are especially suitable for Li-S batteries with high capacity, high stability, and high-rate performance. The opportunities of high-performance separators\/interlayers and their applications in next-generation Li-S batteries were also involved. New insights on the role of working separators\/interlayers in practical Li-S cells should be further explored to obtain the principle and process for advanced components for energy storage devices based on multi-electron conversion reactions.

This hybrid gel is synthesized by the sequential steps of polymerization of pyrrole and gelation of agarose. Depending on the relative concentration of each constituent of the hybrid gel, its electrical and thermal behavior changes significantly. In addition, the type of solvent medium that comprises the hybrid gel in the hydrate state highly affects the thermally reversible gelation behavior. Finally, we demonstrate various patterning techniques including nozzle printing, screen printing, and wet spinning for the fabrication of the patterned hybrid gel electrode. This proposed conductive gel will present many new possibilities for biological applications such as electronic skins, biomimetic devices, artificial muscles, neural electrodes, biocompatible redox switches, and stimuli responsive polymeric materials.","6173":"The extracts of Bosciasenegalensis was study as corrosion inhibitors for Aluminium in 1M HCl environment using gravimetric and linear polarization methods. The result shows that the extract inhibits the corrosion of aluminium by elongating the latency periods of the metal beyond in the absence of the inhibitor. The results from gravimetric measurements illustrate increase in inhibition efficiency with increment in extract concentration. Linear polarization plots show that the mode of inhibition was mixed type. The observed decrease in corrosion rate was due to adsorption of the extracts on the surface of the metal which obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Adsorption of the extract depends on its chemical composition which showed the presence of various phytochemicals like flavonoids, steroids, tannins and phenolic compounds etc. which has oxygen atoms with lone pair electrons for co-ordinate bonding with metal.","1793":"Flexible lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are of increasing interest as mobile power supply for the next-generation of flexible electronics. The current flexible LIBs are generally limited by relatively poor ductility, short cycle-life and low charge and discharge rate. Herein, we report a rational design and preparation of flexible ultra-long, aligned carbon nanofibers thin films with embedded In2O3 nanocrystals (In2O3@FUACNFF) as a binder free anode for highly flexible LIBs. In this work, needleless electrospinning has been demonstrated to be to an effective method for the preparation of In2O3@FUACNFF with super-high throughput. The In2O3@FUACNFF can ensure excellent charge transport, electrolyte transport and mechanical flexibility, thus leading to excellent electrochemical performance and exceptional flexibility. The In2O3@FUACNFF exhibited excellent cycling ability even after 500 cycles, with a capacity of 545.6 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and rate performance even at the highest current density of 100 A g(-1) with a reversible capacity of 224.2 mA h g(-1). Moreover, highly flexible full batteries were also fabricated to demonstrate the superior durability (the electrical stability of the manufactured flexible full battery was hardly affected after more than 120 times folding cycles), excellent cycle-ability (the capacity retention was almost 100% in the measured range from the 17th cycle on) and high rate performance (321.4 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1)).

These bio-inspired functionalized vesicles concentrate the catalytic subunits in close proximity and show light driven hydrogen generation in the presence of ascorbic acid resulting in 651 and 2.47 x 10(5) catalytic turnovers for the membrane- incorporated catalyst and the QDs, respectively.","2111":"Interest in chemical functionalisation of graphenes today is largely driven by associated changes to its physical and material properties. Functionalisation with hydrogen was employed to obtain hydrogenated graphenes (also termed graphane if fully hydrogenated), which exhibited properties including fluorescence, magnetism and a tuneable band gap. Although the classical Birch reduction has been employed for hydrogenation of graphite oxide, variation exists between the choice of alkali metals and alcohols\/water as quenching agents. A systematic study of electron (Li, Na, K, Cs) and proton sources (tBuOH, iPrOH, MeOH, H2O) has been performed to identify optimal conditions. The proton source exerted a great influence on the resulting hydrogenation with water and out-performed alcohols, and the lowest carbon-to-hydrogen ratio was observed with sodium and water with composition of C1.4H1O0.3. Although ferromagnetism at room temperature correlates well with increasing hydrogen concentrations, small contributions from trace iron impurities cannot be completely eliminated. In contrast, hydrogenated graphenes exhibit a significant paramagnetic moment at low temperatures that has no correlation with impurities, and therefore, originates from the carbon system. This is in comparison to graphene, which is strongly diamagnetic, and concentrations of paramagnetic centres in hydrogenated graphenes are one order of magnitude larger than that in graphite. Nonetheless, hydrogenation over a particular level might also excessively disrupt intrinsic sp(2) conjugation, resulting in unintended reduction of electrochemical properties. This was observed with heterogeneous electron-transfer rates and it was postulated that hydrogenated graphenes should generally have high defect densities, but only moderately high hydrogenation, should they be employed as electrode materials.","4977":"We report a ternary composite vanadium\/single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)\/carbon nanofibers (VSCNFs) material using hybrid-electrospinning and carbonizing of polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylpyrrolidone, SWCNTs and vanadyl acetylacetonate. The morphology and structure of the ternary composites are characterized. Its electrochemical properties are measured in a 6 mol L-1 aqueous KOH electrolyte. VSCNFs possesses a hierarchical structure with micropores and mesopores and a specific surface area of 821 m(2) g(-1), and it also exhibits a reversible specific capacitance of 479 F g(-1) A g(-1) and 367.4 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1), and retains 94% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles (8 A g(-1)). The results show that simultaneously adding vanadium and SWCNTs can greatly enhance the conductivity, capacitive performance and stability by forming a closer connection with nanofibers through V-N-C, V-O-C and V=O bonds. SWNCTs are not only mechanically mixed in CNFs to enhance the extent of graphitization, but also involved in the transmutation process of CNFs graphitization with the participation of vanadium.","4671":"Sn doped TiO2 (SDT) hierarchical nanorods have been synthesized by using nanocystalline cellulose nanorod as biotemplate. Experimental results show that the phase transition from anatase to rutile can be realized by increasing the calcination temperature. In contrast to enhancing the calcination temperature, the Sn doping can more effectively improve the phase transition with remaining morphology due to the similar ionic radius and charge between Sn and Ti. The crystallinity, electronic structure, interface charge transfer process, and the specific surface area have a strong effect on the photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical TiO2 and SDT nanorods. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of SDT hierarchical nanorods can be obviously improved by loaded Au nanoparticles on the surface due to the local surface plasmon resonance effect of Au and formation of a Schottky barrier at the Au\/TiO2 interface, which is in favor of the effective separation of photoinduced carriers and the formation of superoxide anion radicals.","737":"Developing cost-effective electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basicmedia is critical to renewable energy conversion technologies. Here, we report a ternary hybrid that is constructed by in situ growth of cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se) nanosheets vertically oriented on electrochemically exfoliated graphene foil, with subsequent deposition of NiFe layered-double-hydroxide by a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting 3D hierarchical hybrid, possessing a high surface area of 156 m(2) g(-1) and strong coupling effect, exhibits excellent catalytic activity for OER, which only requires overpotentials of 1.50 and 1.51 V to attain current densities of 150 and 250 mA cm(-2), respectively. These overpotentials are much lower than those reported for other non-noble-metal materials and Ir\/C catalysts. The hybrid also efficiently catalyzes HER in base with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -0.26 V. Most importantly, we achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.71 V by using the 3D hybrid as both a cathode and an anode for overall water splitting, which is well comparable to the integrated performance of Pt\/C and Ir\/C catalysts.","3246":"Here we report the fabrication of high-performance all-carbon temperature and infrared (IR) sensors with a solvent-free multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) trace as the sensing element and commercial graphite pencil trace as the electrical contact on recyclable and biodegradable cellulose filter paper without using any toxic materials or complex procedures. The temperature sensor shows a large negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) in the range of -3100 ppm K-1 to -4900 ppm K-1, which is comparable to available commercial temperature sensors, and an activation energy of 34.85 meV. The IR sensor shows a high responsivity of 58.5 V W-1, which is greater than reported IR sensors with similar dimensions. A detailed study of the conduction mechanism in MWCNTs with temperature and the photo response with IR illumination was done and it was found that the conduction is due to thermally assisted hopping in band tails and the photo response is bolometric in nature. The successful fabrication of these sensors on cellulose filter paper with a comparable performance to existing components indicates that it is possible to fabricate high-performance electronics using low-cost, eco-friendly materials without the need for expensive clean-room processing techniques or harmful chemicals.","3689":"Porous carbon, which is the most widely used cathode material ever for Li-O-2 batteries, is found to decompose in the charging process, promote electrolyte decomposition, and react with the discharge product. Carbon-free cathodes thus become critical for Li-O-2 batteries, but generally exhibit low capacity and poor rate because of their high density and insufficient pore characteristic. Herein, we present a simple method to prepare a core-shell-structured TiO2(B) nanofiber@porous RuO2 composite, which is used as a carbon-free catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The RuO2 coating layer replicates the structure of TiO2 nanofibers to form a one-dimensional RuO2 shell with a typical hierarchical mesoporous\/macroporous structure. Besides the reduced undesired decomposition, the abundant porous structure and inherent high conductivity of the RuO2 coating layer also increase the specific capacity, efficiency, rate ability and cycle life. With a high mass loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) on the cathode, the Li-O-2 battery shows a performance superior to previous reports, including high capacity (800 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.125 mA cm(-2) or 50 mA g(-1)) with a very high energy efficiency of >82.5%, good rate (500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) or 200 mA g(-1)) and long-life (80 cycles at a fixed capacity of 300 mA h g(-1)). It is also demonstrated that the lithiation\/de-lithiation of RuO2 can contribute capacity over the charge\/discharge process, indicating that this battery can be operated as a rechargeable RuO2\/Li battery without O-2 in the environment.","5601":"This paper presents the results of an experimental study about the effects of pumice powder, different water\/(cement + mineral additive) ratios and pumice aggregates on some physical and mechanical properties of self-compacting lightweight aggregate concrete. In this study, pumice was used as lightweight aggregates. Several properties of self-compacting pumice aggregate lightweight concretes such as unit weight, flow diameter, T50 time, flow diameter after an hour, V-funnel time and L-box tests, 7, 28, 90 and 180-day compressive strength, 28-day splitting tensile strength, dry unit weight, water absorption, thermal conductivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests were investigated. For this purpose, 24 series of concrete samples were prepared in two groups. In the first group, pumice aggregate at the rate of 100% was used for the production of self-compacting lightweight aggregate concrete with constant w\/(c + m) ratios as 0.35, 0.40 and 0.45 by weight. Furthermore as the second group, pumice aggregate was used as a replacement of natural aggregate, at the levels of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% by volume with fly ash and blast furnace slag mineral additives at the constant rate of 40%. The flow diameters, T50 times, paste volumes, 28-day compressive strengths, dry unit weights, thermal conductivities and ultrasonic pulse velocity of self-compacting lightweight aggregate concrete were obtained in the range of 560-800 mm, 2-11 s, 435-558 l\/m(3), 10.5-65.0 MPa, 840-2278 kg\/m(3), 0.347-1.694 W\/mK and 2611-4770 m\/s respectively, which satisfies not only the strength requirement of semi-structural lightweight concrete but also the flowing ability requirements and thermal conductivity requirements of self-compacting lightweight aggregate concrete.

The Se molecules are chemically bonded and physical encapsulated by carbonized PAN-CNT composite (CNFs-CNT), which leads to prevent the dissolution of polyselenide intermediates in carbonate based electrolyte. When directly used as flexible free-standing cathode material for Li-Se batteries in low cost carbonate-based electrolyte, the Se@CNFs-CNT electrode exhibits improved cyclability (517 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)) and rate capability (485 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)). Moreover, when tested as sodium batteries, it maintains a reversible capacity of 410 mAh g(-1) after 240 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The superior electrochemical performance (especially at high rates) of Se@CNFs-CNT is attributed to synergistic effect of the additive of CNT, the well confine of Se in the CNFs-CNT matrix through chemical bonding and the 3D interconnected carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This simple yet efficient process thus provides a promising route towards fabrication of a variety of high performance flexible Li-Se and Na-Se batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Solvent characteristics play a major role in determining the morphology of the organic material. A thiophene derivative (7,9-di(thiophen-2-yl)-8H-cyclopenta[a]acenaphthylen-8-one) (DTCPA) of donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) architecture is used to study this solvent effect. Seven solvents with decreasing vapour pressure are selected for experiments. Electrospraying is conducted at a solution concentration of 1.5 wt% and a constant applied voltage of 15 kV. Gradual transformation in morphology of the electrospun product from spiked-spheres to only spikes is observed. A mechanism describing this transformation is proposed based on electron micrograph analysis and XRD analysis. These data indicate that the morphological change is due to the synergistic effect of both vapour pressure and dielectric constant of the solvents. Through a reasonable control of the crystallite size and morphology along with the proposal of the transformation mechanism, this study elucidates electrospraying as a prospective method for designing architectures in organic electronics.","789":"Protein\/polysaccharide electrostatic complexes have been widely used in food products to confer structure and stability. Intramolecular soluble complexes (ISCs) have superior emulsifying properties in stabilizing oil-in-water (o\/w) emulsions. This paper investigates the potential application of ISCs to stabilize polyunsaturated fatty acids that were difficult to disperse and liable to oxidation. The idea was demonstrated using whey protein isolate\/gum arabic (WPI\/GA) ISCs and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Zeta potential measurements indicated a stoichiometry of r = 1.0 for the electrostatic complexation of WPI\/GA. Excess of GA (r < 1.0) ensured the formation of stable ISCs in a specific pH range, e.g. pH 4.0-5.4 at r = 0.5. The nano-sized ISCs significantly improved the physical and oxidative stabilities of CLA emulsions in comparison with individual WPI or GA. Optimal stabilization was found at a WPI\/GA concentration of 2.0 wt% for emulsions with CLA = 15 wt%. NaCl tended to dissociate ISCs when NaCl > 20 mM and therefore seriously reduced the stability of ISCs-stabilized CLA emulsions. The superiority of ISCs in stabilizing polyunsaturated fatty acids is due to the cooperative adsorption of protein and polysaccharide at the emulsion interface, providing strong steric and electrostatic effects against droplet aggregation and coalescence and thus excellent physical stability. The improved oxidative stability should arise from the free radical scavenging ability of the protein at the emulsion interface, reducing lipid oxidation.","6486":"The development of future energy technology relies deeply on the design of cheap, sustainable and efficient systems for energy conversion and storage.

Strikingly, the as-fabricated Co-N\/C 800 affords a low reversible overvoltage of 0.96 V between ORR and OER, surpassing 270, 390 and 460 mV in potential over 20 wt% Pt\/C, RuO2 and IrO2, which makes it a high performance non-precious metal bicatalyst for reversible oxygen electrode reactions.","1741":"Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) have been prepared by gel-combustion technique using 1:0.5 (N 105) and 1:1 (N 11) weight ratios of oxidizer, nickel nitrate hexahydrate and fuel, cassava starch, respectively. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the samples revealed cubic phase of nickel oxide and the average crystallite size of 28 and 38 nm for N 105 and N 11, respectively, were noted. In comparison to particle size measured using TEM (35 and 60 nm), the average particle size obtained from DIS (250 and 350 nm) was larger for N 105 and N 11, respectively. NiO NPs were found to have indirect band gap (2.98 and 2.3 eV) as revealed by optical spectroscopy. They were tested for energy storage, antimicrobial activity and photocatalytic applications. Electrochemical studies showed NiO NPs had a reversible capacity of 940 and 785 mA h\/g for N 105 and N 11, respectively and they retained a capacity of 59% and 47% upto 50 cycles. The antimicrobial activity was tested against two bacterial strains and a fungal strain. The photocatalytic activity was measured for degradation of methylene blue in ultra-violet as well as sunlight. NiO, obtained by using 1:1 oxidizer to fuel ratio, (N 11) exhibited 94% degradation efficiency in sunlight because of a visible light-active band gap (2.3 eV). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The activated carbon aerogel is a nano-porous material, which has high pore volume of 0.57 cm(3)\/g and surface area of 917 m(2)\/g. The activated carbon aerogel\/polybutadiene composite displayed good response of 11.2 and 6.7 to toluene and n-hexane, respectively, compared to those of graphite\/polybutadiene composite. The activated carbon aerogel\/polybutadiene composite also showed high sensitivity of 3.09 x 10(2) ppm(-1) to toluene. However, the sensitivity of activated carbon aerogel\/polybutadiene composite drastically decreased to 1.99 ppm(-1) and zero when exposed to acetone and water, respectively. Contrarily, when polyvinyl alcohol was used as a matrix, the sensitivity was about 4.19 ppm(-1) to water. While the composite was found to be not sensitive to toluene.

The influence of nanotechnology on the healthcare industry is substantial, particularly in the areas of disease diagnosis and treatment. Recent investigations in nanotechnology for drug delivery and tissue engineering have delivered high-impact contributions in translational research, with associated pharmaceutical products and applications. Over the past decade, the synthesis of nanofibers or nanoparticles via electrostatic spinning or spraying, respectively, has emerged as an important nanostructuring methodology. This is due to both the versatility of the electrospinning\/electrospraying process and the ensuing control of nanofiber\/nanoparticle surface parameters. Electrosprayed nanoparticles and electrospun nanofibers are both employed as natural or synthetic carriers for the delivery of entrapped drugs, growth factors, health supplements, vitamins, and so on. The role of nanofiber\/nanoparticle carriers is substantiated by the programmed, tailored, or targeted release of their contents in the guise of tissue engineering scaffolds or medical devices for drug delivery. This review focuses on the nanoformulation of natural materials via the electrospraying or electrospinning of nanoparticles or nanofibers for tissue engineering or drug delivery\/pharmaceutical purposes.

We synthesized high aspect ratio nanofibers of NiO by simple and cost effective sol-gel based electrospinning followed by annealing. In the end, these nanofibers were composed of densely packed hexagonal nanoparticles of polycrystalline NiO having diameters of similar to 15 nm. The ASC was capable of operating in the potential window of 1.5 V in 6 M KOH solution with a gravimetric capacitance of 141 F g(-1) and energy density of 43.75 W h kg(-1).

Though the outer diameter and length of the two fibers are comparable, the former exhibited much higher electric conductivity and visible-light transmittance than the latter.

They are also effective in vivo as anti-tumor promoting, cell proliferating inhibitors and chemo preventing agents. Results: Synthesis and molecular structure investigation of (E)-3-mesityl-1-(naphthalen-2-yl) prop-2-en-1-one (3) is reported. The structure of the title compound 3 is confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The optimized molecular structure of the studied compound is calculated using DFT B3LYP\/6-311G (d, p) method. The calculated geometric parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from our reported X-ay structure. The calculated IR fundamental bands were assigned and compared with the experimental data. The electronic spectra of the studied compound have been calculated using the time dependant density functional theory (TD-DFT). The longest wavelength band is due to H -> L (79 %) electronic transition which belongs to pi-pi* excitation. The H-1-and C-13-NMR chemical shifts were calculated using gauge independent atomic orbitals (GIAO) method, which showed good correlations with the experimental data (R-2 = 0.9911-0.9965). The natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations were performed to predict the natural atomic charges at different atomic sites. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) was used to visualize the charge distribution on the molecule.

To make it viable, it is essential to control the complex reacting environment in their fuel electrode. In this study, dominant reaction pathway and species transport taking place in the fuel electrode and their effect on the cell performance are elucidated. Results show that steam is a primary reactant in electrolysis, and CO2 contributes to the electrochemical performance subsequently in addition to the effect of steam. CO2 reduction is predominantly governed by thermochemical reactions, whose influence to the electrochemical performance is evident near limiting currents. Chemical kinetics and mass transport play a significant role in co-electrolysis, given that the reduction reactions and diffusion of steam\/CO2 mixtures are slow. The characteristic time scales determined by the kinetics, diffusion and materials dictate the cell performance and product compositions. The fuel electrode design should account for microstructure and catalysts for steam electrolysis and thermochemical CO2 reduction in order to optimize syngas production and store electrical energy effectively and efficiently. Syngas yield and selectivity are discussed, showing that they are substantially influenced by operating conditions, fuel electrode materials and its microstructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that stretching these films induces changes in the secondary structure of PLL chains. Our results suggest that not only alpha- but also 3(10)-helices might form in the film under stretching. Such 3(10)-helices have never been observed for PLL so far. These changes of the secondary structure of PLL are reversible, i.e., when returning to the nonstretched state one recovers the initial film structure. Using molecular dynamics simulations of chains composed of 20 L-lysine residues (PLL20), we find that these chains never adokt a helical conformation in water. In contrast, when the end-to-end distance of the chains is restrained to values smaller than the mean end-to-end distance of free chains, a distance domain rarely explored by the free chains, helical conformations become accessible. Moreover, the formation of not only alpha- but also 3(10)-helices is predicted by the simulations. These results suggest that the change of the end-to-end distance of PLL chains in the stretched film is at the origin of the helix formation.","1174":"A novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor was developed for the determination of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) by using N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI)-functionalized gold nanodots\/chitosan\/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (ABEI\/GNDs\/chitosan\/COOH-MWCNTs) hybrid as nanointerface. First, ABEI\/GNDs\/chitosan\/COOH-MWCNTs hybrid nanomaterials were grafted onto the surface of ITO electrode via the film-forming property of hybrid nanomaterials. The anti-NT-proBNP antibody was connected to the surface of modified electrode by virtue of amide reaction via glutaraldehyde. The obtained sensing platform showed strong and stable ECL signal. When NT-proBNP was captured by its antibody immobilized on the sensing platform via immunoreaction, the ECL intensity decreased. Direct ECL signal changes were used for the determination of NT-proBNP. The present ECL immunosensor demonstrated a quite wide linear range of 0.01100 pg\/mL. The achieved low detection limit of 3.86 fg\/mL was about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with electrochemistry method reported previously. Because of the simple and fast analysis, high sensitivity and selectivity, and stable and reliable response, the present immunosensor has been successfully applied to quantify NT-proBNP in practical plasma samples. The success of the sensor in this work also confirms that ABEI\/GNDs\/chitosan\/COOH-MWCNTs hybrid is an ideal nanointerface to fabricate a sensing platform.

A central composite face-centered design and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied to optimize concentrations of cellulose, yeast extract (YE), and magnesium chloride (Mg) in culture. The overall optimum composition generated by the desirability function resulted in 57.28 mmol H-2\/L-culture with 1.30 mol H-2\/mol glucose and 7.48 mmol\/(g center dot cell center dot h) when cultures contained 25 g\/L cellulose, 2 g\/L YE, and 1.75 g\/L Mg. Compared with the unaltered medium, the optimized medium produced approximately 3.2-fold more H-2 within the same time-frame with 50% higher specific productivity, which are also better than previously reported values from similar studies. Nutrient composition that diverted carbon and electron flux away from H-2 promoting ethanol production was also determined.

The properties, including proton conductivity, mechanical properties, water uptake and swelling ratio were thoroughly investigated. The proton conductivity of the sNCC\/Ph-SPEEKK composite membrane was much higher than that of pure Ph-SPEEKK in the range of 30-90 degrees C when the sNCC ratio was less than 10%. The presence of the hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups on the sNCC was supposed to benefit the network formation via hydrogen bonds for the proton conduction. In addition, the mechanical properties of the composite membranes were much improved compared with those of the pure Ph-SPEEKK membrane. And the swelling ratio of the composite membranes was acceptable for the application. It was proved that the incorporation of sNCC into the sulfonated polymer matrix as a component to enhance the performance of the proton exchange membrane is one of the promising preparation strategies.","4595":"Reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foams were manufactured by multiple replications of a polyurethane foam template structure using ethanolic solutions of phenolic resin.

The optical transmission and reflection of such nanostructures, which act as nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) actuators, can be electrically controlled by varying their geometrical parameters, giving them great flexibility for numerous applications in photonics, opto-electronics, and sensing. The previous challenges in controlling the optical properties were overcome by forming a metallic subwavelength grating with an NEMS actuator in mid-air, allowing the grating to be physically moved with the bias voltage. The device can shift the plasmon resonance wavelength with an electrical signal. The resonance wavelength for Wood's anomaly at the infrared region is predicted through simulations to shift by approximately 150 nm.

We accomplish the goal by calculating free energy diagrams for the redox reactions of oxygen to identify a rate-determining step controlling the overpotentials. We unveil that the catalytic performance is well described by the adsorption energies of the intermediates LiO2, and Li2O2 and propose that graphene-based materials can be substantially optimized through either by N doping or encapsulating Cu(111) single crystals. Furthermore, our systematic approach with DFT calculations applied to design of optimum catalysts enables screening of promising candidates for the oxygen electro-chemistry leading to considerable improvement of efficiency of a range of renewable energy devices.","6853":"We have designed new imine-functionalized graphene oxide (IFGO) through post synthetic modifications involving co-condensation of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane with graphene oxide basal plane containing hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups, followed by Schiff base condensation reaction with 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol and impregnation of copper(II) to it through covalent attachment (Cu-IFGO). Powder Xray diffraction, N-2 sorption analysis, FT-IR, HR-TEM, FE-SEM and TGA\/DTA analysis are employed to characterize the materials. The IFGO material exhibits good CO2 storage capacity of 8.10 mmol g(-1) (35.64 wt%) and 2.10 mmol g(-1) (9.24 wt%) at 273 K and 298 K temperature, respectively, up to 3 bar pressure, suggesting its potential application in environmental clean-up. Also, Cu-IFGO showed high catalytic activity in microwave-assisted one-pot three-component C-S coupling reactions for a diverse range of aryl halides with thiourea and benzyl bromide in aqueous medium to obtain aryl thioether products (maximum yield 86%), which are derivatives of natural products. Moreover, having imine and hydroxyl groups in functionalized graphene oxide, the grafted Cu(II) chelated at the graphene oxide surface so strongly that it could not be leached out from the material during the course of the coupling reaction. Thus, it displayed very small decrease in product yield up to the sixth reaction cycle suggesting a sustainable future of this Cu(II)-grafted catalyst.","1034":"Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) grafted with p-aminophenyl--d-manno-pyranoside (APMP) and folic acid (FA) (APMP-FA-SLNs) were applied to encapsulate 4-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-(4,6-O-ethylidene--d-glucopyranoside) (etoposide) (ETP) for promoting the antiproliferation of malignant glioblastoma multiforme. ETP-loaded APMP-FA-SLNs (APMP-FA-ETP-SLNs) were used to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and retard the propagation of U87MG cells. An incorporation of APMP and FA increased the particle size, the cytotoxicity to U87MG cells, and the permeability coefficient for propidium iodide and ETP across the BBB. In addition, an increase in the APMP and FA concentration reduced the zeta potential, the grafting efficiency of APMP and FA, the dissolution rate of ETP, and the transendothelial electrical resistance. Immunochemical staining images evidenced that APMP-FA-ETP-SLNs could infiltrate the BBB via glucose transporter 1 and recognize U87MG cells via folate receptor. APMP-FA-ETP-SLNs can be an effective pharmacotherapeutic formulation in targeting delivery to the brain and in inhibitory efficacy against tumorous cells for cancer therapy.

It was established as a result of the modification of bentonite a surface area and an interlayer distance of mineral decrease and particles of bentonite transformed of irregular shape with different porosity on irregularly shaped particles of smaller size. It has been found that the total Cr(VI) ions extraction took place under the acid conditions (pH=1 - 2) and W(VI) ions have been well adsorbed in the pH range from 1 to 8 by the composite bentonite-PANI unlike the initial mineral. Whereas adsorption of oxo anions of V(V) and Mo(VI) made up some 50%. It is proved that the in situ immobilization of bentonite by polyaniline leads to increasing the value of adsorption capacity towards the investigated ions compared with the initial mineral. It was established that the adsorption properties of the synthesized composite with respect to the studied oxo ions were worse than the adsorption properties of composite vermiculite-PANI, similar to the composite Sokyryntsyy clinoptilolite-PANI and better than composites of polyaniline with Podilskyy saponite and Karelian shungite.","960":"With willow catkins as highly accessible carbon sources, hierarchical porous carbon microtubes (denoted as HPNCTs) have been successfully prepared by a facile carbonization and subsequent KOH activation process. The resulting materials not only inherited the natural tubular morphology of willow catkins, but also developed a hierarchical porous structure by activation, with nitrogen from the biomass being self-doped in the resulting carbon. A maximum specific surface area of 1775.7 m(2) g(-1) with a pore volume of 0.8516 cm(3) g(-1) was achieved for HPNCT-800. When evaluated as an electrode by a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH aqueous solution, the material exhibited a high gravimetric capacitance of 292 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), with a good rate capability of 83.5% retention at 10 A g(-1). HPNCT-800 was further employed in a coin-type symmetric device with 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte, and exhibited a high energy density of 37.9 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 700 W kg(-1), with excellent cycling stability with 90.6% retention after 4000 cycles. By taking advantage of the unique structure of abundant biomass from nature, this work sheds light on the creation of advanced porous carbon materials towards energy storage applications.","2173":"Chitosan (CHI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PM) polyelectrolyte multilayers were constructed onto silica microparticles with particle diameter of 40 60 pm (Daisogel type). The multilayers were subject to two post-treatment strategies: (i) immersion in an aqueous solution with pH = 2.4 for 5 min, followed by immersion for I min in water and thermal treatment at 120 degrees C for 60 min and (ii) cross-linking with glutaraldehyde for 60 min. The sorption properties for a cationic dye were investigated taking methylene blue (MB) as a model. The reusability of (CHI\/PAA)(n) multilayers deposited onto Daisogel microparticles in the consecutive sorption\/desorption cycles of MB was investigated as a function of the number of double layers and the post-treatment strategy.","1558":"The compressional behavior and the P-induced crystal-fluid interaction of a natural paulingite-K have been explored on the basis of in-situ single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, and in-situ single-crystal Raman spectroscopy with a diamond anvil cell and a series of diverse pressure-transmitting fluids (i.e., silicone-oil, methanol:ethanol = 4:1, methanol:ethanol:water = 16:3:1). No evidence of any phase transition was observed within the P-range investigated, independent on the used P-fluids. The compressional behavior of paulingite is significantly different in response to the different nature of the P-fluids. A drastically lower compressibility is observed when the zeolite is compressed in methanol:ethanol or, even more noticeably, in methanol:ethanol:water mix. We ascribe this phenomenon to the different crystal-fluid interaction at high pressure: (1) silicone-oil is a \"non-penetrating\" P-medium, because of its polymeric nature, whereas (2) methanol-ethanol and water are \"penetrating\" P-fluids. The P-induced penetration processes appear to be completely reversible on the basis of the X-ray diffraction data alone. The Raman spectra collected after the high-pressure experiments show, unambiguously, that a residual fraction of methanol (and\/or ethanol and probably even extra H2O) still resides in the zeolitic subnanocavities; such molecules are spontaneously released after a few days at atmospheric pressure. The actual compressibility of paulingite-K is that obtained by the compression experiment in silicone-oil, with an isothermal bulk modulus K-o =beta(-1)(0) = 18.0(1.1) GPa. Paulingite appears to be one of the softest zeolite ever found. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The coating of nickel-ferrite nanoparticles with chitosan was performed simultaneously with the synthesis of the nickel-ferrite nanoparticles by a chemical co-precipitation method. The coated nanoparticles were cylindrical in shape with an average length of 17 nm and an average width of 4.4 nm. The bonding of chitosan onto the ferrite nanoparticles was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The T-1 and T-2 relaxivities were 0.858 +\/- 0.04 and 1.71 +\/- 0.03 mM(-1) s(-1) respectively. In animal experimentation, both a 25% signal enhancement in the T-1-weighted mage and a 71% signal loss in the T-2-weighted image were observed. This demonstrated that chitosan-coated nickel-ferrite nanoparticles are suitable as both T-1 and T-2 contrast agents in MRI. We note that the applicability of our nanoparticles as both T-1 and T-2 contrast agents is due to their cylindrical shape, which gives rise to both inner and outer sphere processes of nanoparticles.

Complex tests of elastomeric compositions with highly dispersed carbon additives allowed us to confirm the model of nonlinear elastic deformation of macromolecules and adhesion between the elastomer and the nanoparticles. The results of these investigations agree with those obtained in determining the Mooney viscosity and relaxation, the parameters of the vulcanization kinetics of rubber mix, conventional tensile strength, and relative breaking elongation of highly filled rubbers based on butadiene-nitrile caoutchoucs. To verify the assumed mechanism underlying the action of a carbon nanomaterial on elastomer compositions, the parameters of their vulcanizing network have been determined using the method of equilibrium swelling.","6369":"In this work, we have developed a green, simple, and low-cost hydrothermal method using wool and pig hair as the precursor to fabricate sulfur- and nitrogen-doped carbon dots (CDs). The precursors are natural and nontoxic raw materials, and the one-step strategy requires no organic solvents. The as-prepared carbon dots exhibit good water dispersibility, strong fluorescence emission with a relatively high quantum yield of 25.6% (contributed by the doped N and S elements), excellent pH stabilities and high ionic strength tolerance. More importantly, the fluorescence intensity of the CDs could be significantly and selectively quenched in the presence of Cr(VI) due to the oxidation-reduction reaction between Cr(VI) and the oxygen-containing groups and S-related species on the surface of CDs. Accordingly, the CDs are employed as a fluorescent probe for the detection of Cr(VI) ions in water. This CDs sensor exhibits high sensitivity to Cr(VI) with a limit of detection of 16.8 nM in a wide range of 50 nM to 100 mM. Furthermore, the sensor is successfully applied in the detection of Cr(VI) in real water samples.","1632":"Electrospinning is a popular nanotechnology used to produce fibrous scaffolds from a wide range of materials. For tissue regeneration and bioengineering applications, there is a growing interest in fabricating tailored 3D scaffolds with a complex tissue-like structure, i.e., nanometer diameter, aligned fibers and controllable thickness that may be suitable for specific organs and tissues. However, conventional electrospinning techniques can only produce either 2D aligned nanofibrous structures with limited thickness or 3D fibrous scaffolds with disordered fibrous structures. In this study, a novel electrospinning setup using a parallel double thin plate collector device and a separate fiber removal device was developed to generate 3D electrospun scaffolds with aligned nanofibers and controllable thickness. As a demonstration, the formation mechanism of the ordered fibrous structure was analyzed, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was processed into fibrous scaffolds. The nanofibrous membranes possessed a high alignment degree with approximately 76% of the fibers within +\/-5 degrees and tailored thicknesses from 69.6 to 1144.9 mu m.

To tackle this challenge, millimeter-scale magnetic cellulose-based beads with micro and nanopore structure were fabricated via an optimal extrusion dropping technology from NaOH\/urea aqueous solution. The composite beads incorported with carboxyl decorated magnetite nanoparticles and nitric acid modified activated carbon have convenient operation based on sensitive magnetic response and highly effective removal performance for Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+. Their structure and properties were investigated. Moreover, the adsorption equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics of Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ by the prepared composite adsorbents were examined. The results revealed that these adsorption processes were spontaneous endothermic reactions and determined by combination of physical and chemical adsorptive mechanisms.","2574":"Metallic and catalytically active materials with high surface area and large porosity are a long-desired goal in both industry and academia. In this Account, we summarize the strategies for making a variety of self-supported noble metal aerogels consisting of extended metal backbone nanonetworks. We discuss their outstanding physical and chemical properties, including their three-dimensional network structure, the simple control over their composition, their large specific surface area, and their hierarchical porosity. Additionally, we show some initial results on their excellent performance as electrocatalysts combining both high catalytic activity and high durability for fuel cell reactions such as ethanol oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finally, we give some hints on the future challenges in the research area of metal aerogels. We believe that metal aerogels are a new, promising class of electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and will also open great opportunities for other electrochemical energy systems, catalysis, and sensors. The commercialization of PEFCs encounters three critical obstacles, viz., high cost, insufficient activity, and inadequate long-term durability. Besides others, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and alcohol oxidation and insufficient catalyst stability are important reasons for these obstacles. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these obstacles, e.g., by controlling the catalyst particle size in an optimized range, forming multimetallic catalysts, controlling the surface compositions, shaping the catalysts into nanocrystals, and designing supportless catalysts with extended surfaces such as nanostructured thin films, nanotubes, and porous nanostructures. These efforts have produced plenty of excellent electrocatalysts, but the development of multisynergetic functional catalysts exhibiting low cost, high activity, and high durability still faces great challenges. In this Account, we demonstrate that the sol-gel process represents a powerful bottom-up strategy for creating nanostructured materials that tackles the problems mentioned above. Aerogels are unique solid materials with ultralow densities, large open pores, and ultimately high inner surface areas. They magnify the specific properties of nanomaterials to the macroscale via self-assembly, which endow them with superior properties. Despite numerous investigations of metal oxide aerogels, the investigation of metal aerogels is in the early stage. Recently, aerogels including Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, and Cu have been obtained by nanosmelting of hybrid polymer-metal oxide aerogels. We report here exclusively on mono-, bi- and multimetallic noble metal aerogels consisting of Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd and their application as electrocatalysts.","5303":"N-doped carbon fibers and their composites have drawn much attention because of their wide application in energy storage. In this paper, NiOx nanoparticles are anchored on N-doped carbon fibers by chemical bonds with controlled concentration of NiOx, and the fibers interweave into hierarchical structured networks. It is demonstrated that these NiOx nanoparticles consisted of both NiO and Ni-0 other than a single phase. As binder-free anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the NiOx-C fiber networks obtained at 650 degrees C with 9.2 wt% NiOx could deliver a specific capacity of 676 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). It is also found that the storage and rate capacities of the networks are dependent on both the content of NiOx and the annealing temperature. The improved lithium-ion storage properties can be ascribed to the intimate connection between NiOx and the highly conductive network of carbon fibers through chemical bonds.","5171":"The present work reports the synthesis of self-assembled 1-D polycrystalline Fe doped CuO nanostructures (Cu1-xFexO, x = 0.02 (SP2), 0.05 (SP5), 0.10 (SP10)) using a wet chemical approach. The surface analysis of these nanostructures by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated Fe to be present as Fe3+. The doping of Fe (2 to 10%) causes exchange of Cu in CuO and creates point defects - oxygen vacancies, which are manifested by the change in morphologies of doped nanostructures from nanochains to nanofibers, a reduction in the size of CuO NPs from 19 to 5 nm, the red shifted optical absorption and fluorescence bands associated with an increase in the fluorescence lifetime(s) and blue shifted Raman spectra. The field dependent magnetization (M-H) measurements at room temperature show that for SP10 the magnetization value increases by a factor of about 3 as compared to that of the undoped sample and the superparamagnetic behavior increases with increasing Fe-content. Whereas, at 5 K it exhibits ferromagnetic behavior with increasing values of coercivity (1564 Oe) and retentivity (0.19 emu g(-1)) and exchange bias effect decreasing with increased doping of Fe. The room temperature polarization versus electric field measurements at 200 Hz show weak ferroelectric behavior for all samples and increases with increasing Fe content in the sample. Dielectric constant and dielectric loss show decreasing values with increasing frequency. A correlation between the observed changes in morphology with optical, magnetic and ferroelectric properties upon doping of Fe has been analyzed.","168":"Attachment of engineered and naturally occurring macromolecules greatly affects the environmental fate and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). A better understanding of macromolecule-ENM interactions at the nanoscale will improve the ability to predict the effects of macromolecular coatings, e.g. natural organic matter (NOM), on ENM fate, reactivity, and toxicity. This review briefly discusses relevant theory from colloid and polymer science for highly idealized polymers on surfaces that can be used to describe ENM environmental behaviors and introduces classes of macromolecules of interest in the field of environmental nanotechnology. Methods to characterize adsorbed macromolecules on ENMs are presented along with their limitations for ENMs in natural systems. Finally, the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of attached organic macromolecules, both engineered and incidental, on the environmental fate and reactivity of ENMs is critically reviewed. These concepts in whole are synthesized to identify the fundamental gaps in understanding and metrology that must be addressed to improve our mechanistic understanding of the effects of organic macromolecules on ENM environmental fate, and approaches to correlate the properties of coated ENMs to their environmental fate are discussed. We postulate that a first principles approach to modeling ENM-macromolecule interactions is not warranted, particularly for complex and heterogeneous natural macromolecules. On the other hand, a mechanistic understanding is needed to inform parameter selection for empirical correlations, which may offer tractable alternatives to predicting the behavior of macromolecule-coated ENMs. Development of these empirical correlations and prediction of the long-term fate of ENMs is currently hampered by incomplete characterization of the adsorbed macromolecule layer properties and their evolution over time in natural systems.","1419":"Lignin derivatives, which arise as waste products from the pulp and paper industry and are mainly used for heating, can be used as charge storage materials. The charge storage function is a result of the quinone groups formed in the lignin derivative. Herein, we modified lignins to enhance the density of such quinone groups by covalently linking monolignols and quinones through phenolation. The extra guaiacyl, syringyl, and hydroquinone groups introduced by phenolation of kraft lignin derivatives were monitored by P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance and size exclusion chromatography. Electropolymerization in ethylene glycol\/tetraethylammonium tosylate electrolyte was used to synthesize the kraft lignin\/polypyrrole hybrid films. These modifications changed the phenolic content of the kraft lignin with attachment of hydroquinone units yielding the highest specific capacity (around 70mAhg(-1)). The modification of softwood and hardwood lignin derivatives yielded 50% and 23% higher charge capacity than the original lignin, respectively.","1402":"Biocompatible nanostructured surfaces control the cell behaviors and tissue integration process of medical devices and implants. Here we develop a novel biocompatible nanostructured surface based on mesoporous silica nanotube (MSNT) by means of an electrodeposition. MSNTs, replicated from carbon nanotubes of 25 nm x 1200 nm size, were interfaced in combination with fugitive biopolymers (chitosan or collagen) onto a Ti metallic substrate. The MSNT-biopolymer deposits uniformly covered the substrate with weight gains controllable by the electrodeposition conditions. Random nanotubular networks were generated successfully, which alongside the high mesoporosity provided unique nanotopological properties for the cell responses and the loading\/delivery of biomolecules. Of note, the adhesion and spreading behaviors of mesenchyrnal stem cells (MSCs) were significantly altered, revealing more rapid cell anchorage and extensive nanofilopodia development along the nanotubular networks. Furthermore, the nanotubular surface improved the loading capacity of biomolecules (dexamethasone and bovine serum albumin) up to 5-7 times. The release of the biomolecules was highly sustained, exhibiting a diffusion-controlled pattern over 15 days. The therapeutic efficacy of the delivered biomolecules was also confirmed in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. While in vivo performance and applicability studies are needed further, the current biocompatible nanostructured surface may be considered as a novel biointerfacing platform to control cellular behaviors and biomolecular delivery.","1978":"A higher-order non-local strain gradient plate model developed for the vibration of piezoelectric nanofilms (PNFs) as nanoelectromechanical mass sensors is presented. The PNF carrying multiple nanoparticles at any locations is subjected to thermo-electro-mechanical loads. Size effects are taken into consideration by introducing three different scale parameters. Using higher-order non-local elasticity, strain gradient theory and Hamilton's principle, the differential equations of motion are derived. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the natural frequencies and frequency shifts of the PNF-based sensor. It is found that the frequency shifts of PNFs can increase or decrease depending on the values of small-scale parameters. The present results would be helpful for designing micro\/nano sensors using PNFs.","6839":"The influence of chemical interaction between poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and Cloisite 10A on rheology, water permeability and antibacterial properties were subjected to detailed investigation. Mats of PCL with varying amounts of Cloisite 10A were prepared by electrospinning technique. The hydrogen bonding interaction between PCL and the organic modifier present in Cloisite 10A encourages the exfoliation\/intercalation of Cloisite 10A resulting in a strong immobilized polymeric zone which was confirmed by small angle oscillatory shear experiments (SAOS). Unimpeded permeation of water through a PCL-Cloisite 10A porous nanocomposites scaffold was confirmed by different diffusion models. This strong immobilized zone or percolated network formation, aids in the elution of the organic modifier present in the nanoclay, which leads to the rupture of the cell wall of the bacteria. The antibacterial properties were tested using Gram positive bacteria and compared with the results obtained for Gram negative bacteria to test the use of our nanocomposites for wound healing applications.","1702":"Antifouling super-repellent surfaces inspired by Nepenthes, the pitcher plant, were designed and named slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). These surfaces repel various simple and complex liquids including water and blood by maintaining a low sliding angle. Previous studies have reported the development of fluorinated SLIPS that are not biocompatible. Here, we fabricated fluid-infused films composed of biodegradable materials and a biocompatible lubricant liquid. The film was constructed using a combination of electrostatic interactions between chitosan and alginate and hydrogen-bonding between alginate and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPON) via the layer-by-layer self-assembly method. After chitosan and alginate were cross-linked, the PVPON was removed by increasing the pH to generate porosity from the deconstruction of the hydrogen-bonding. The porous underlayer was hydrophobized and covered by biocompatible almond oil. Blood easily flowed over this biodegradable and biocompatible SLIPS without leaving stains on the surface, and the material is environmentally durable, has a high transmittance of about 90%, and is antithrombogenic. The results of this study suggest that this SLIPS may facilitate the creation of nonfouling medical devices through a low-cost, eco-friendly, and simple process.","7315":"Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase 1 (PGP-1) can remove pyroglutamic acid from the N-terminus of a polypeptide, including some important anti-inflammatory proteins. Detecting the change and distribution of cellular PGP-1 in an inflammation process would be helpful to better understand the role of this enzyme. However, no report has been found on this subject, mainly due to the lack of a proper research approach. Herein, we develop such a new method by preparing a sensitive long-wavelength fluorescent probe combined with confocal fluorescence imaging. The probe, consisting of L-pyroglutamic acid and cresyl violet, exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity for PGP-1 under physiological conditions. With this probe, the up-regulation of PGP-1 in LO-2 cells under the stimulation of Freund's incomplete adjuvant and lipopolysaccharide (two main immunopotentiators) is revealed for the first time, and this up-regulation is also observed in typical phagocytic RAW264.7 cells, as evidenced by western blot and inhibition assays. Studies on the distribution of PGP-1 in cells using our probe showed that most PGP-1 is located in the cytoplasm, which is further supported by an immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, the inflammatory response induced by the immunopotentiators in either RAW264.7 or LO-2 cells is confirmed by measuring tumor necrosis factor alpha (a common inflammatory factor). The above findings indicate that cellular inflammation is accompanied by an increase in PGP-1, and PGP-1 may serve as a new indicator of cellular inflammatory response.","3482":"In the present study, ZnO nanoparticle preparation in a water-base medium without using toxic chemicals was investigated. Zinc (II) acetate dehydrate, L-leucine and 5-sulfosalicylaldehyde sodium salt were utilized as the startingmaterials. X-ray diffraction analyses proved that ZnO was achieved as a unique phase. The highest value of crystallinity was obtained at 600 degrees C and the minimum values of crystallite size and lattice strain were reported at 400 and 500 degrees C, respectively. The photoluminescence spectroscopy showed that firing at 500 degrees C leads to decrease the point defects in ZnO structure. SEM and TEM images confirmed the relation between the firing temperature, the degree of crystallinity and the crystallite size. Firing at 400 degrees C leads to form ZnO nanoparticles with a size distribution ranging from 15 to 50 nm with cubic, circle and hexagonal shapes. By increasing the temperature to 500 degrees C, the nanoparticles dimensions increase to 30-60 nm. The particle size of sample 'c' is more than 50 nm. The optimum temperature to achieve the goal of this research, namely a high crystallinity and low structure defects, was found to be 500 degrees C.","6714":"Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) possessing a high surface to volume ratio, copious chemically active sites, and ease of separation from aqueous solutions are emerging materials for water treatment. Further encapsulation of these nanoparticles (NPs) with polymeric materials may protect these NPs from direct contact with the aqueous environment and also enhance their sorption efficiency. In the case of polymer fibers, breakage will occur depending on environmental conditions, and the addition of MNPs in fibers will provide an opportunity for the complete recovery of fibers after the sorption process. In the present study, a mixed solution of amine-rich chitosan (CS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) containing magnetic MnFe2O4 nanoparticles was utilized for fabricating versatile and robust magnetic polymer composite fibers (MPCFs) in a facile methodology. The effective fabrication of MPCFs was confirmed by using analytical techniques such as FTIR, XRD, VSM, FE-SEM, and TEM. Morphological characterization demonstrated that MnFe2O4 nanoparticles were well distributed in the composite fibers. Detailed batch sorption experiments revealed that MPCFs exhibited significant improvement in adsorption efficiency compared with bare MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. The MPCFs exhibited high adsorption capacity (371.35 +\/- 16.79 mg g(-1)) and fast equilibrium (within 30 min). The Pt-loaded MPCFs were easily separated from aqueous solution under an external magnetic field. It can be concluded that MPCFs with amine-rich functional groups and magnetic properties are promising for Pt adsorption from aqueous solutions.","3611":"Using lignosulfonate (LS) and alkyl chain-coupled lignosulfonate-based polymer (ALS) as the raw materials, the aggregation behavior of LS and ALS was investigated, and they both showed a unique aggregation behavior to form a block-like self-assembly for the first time. The aggregation behavior and mechanism of LS and ALS were investigated by SEM, TEM and DLS. The block-like aggregates prepared from ALS (micron size) were larger than that of LS (nano size). The unique aggregates were also further confirmed by XPS, meanwhile, SAXS was applied to explore the regular intrinsic characteristics of the block-like aggregates. Inspired by the aggregation behavior of LS and ALS, the electron transfer properties of LS and ALS were also studied including the electrochemical properties and hole mobility measurements. The oxidation peaks at 1.2 V and 1.4 V were observed at the LS and ALS modified electrode, respectively. We studied the hole transport properties of LS and ALS using the space-charge-limited current method (SCLC). Average hole mobilities of 2.95 x 10(-6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 3.18 x 10(-7) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) were estimated for LS and ALS, respectively. The above results indicated that LS and ALS are potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductors, and the hole transport property of LS is better than that of ALS. Based on the unique aggregation behavior and hole mobility property described above which will facilitate charge transport, water soluble PEDOT:LS and PEDOT:ALS were prepared and applied as the hole extraction layer (HEL) in polymer solar cells. The PCE decreased with a decrease of the phenolic hydroxyl group content (-OH), which suggested that -OH is important for the strength of the PCE. The application properties were consistent with the results of the aggregation behavior and electron transfer properties. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.19% from PEDOT: LS-1 : 1 as the HTL was achieved with a device structure of ITO\/HEL\/PTB7:PC71BM\/Al in our study. Our results showed that the phenolic hydroxyl group content and conjugation structure of amorphous LS contribute to its promising potential as a dopant of semiconductors, such as PEDOT in organic electronics. Our results provide a novel perspective for the design of dopants for semiconductive polymers. In summary, the phenolic hydroxyl group of the polymer will provide hole transport capability due to its oxidation during device operation.","2275":"In this paper, 3D hierarchical porous Co3O4 materials (HPCo) were synthesized via a PS spheres templated transformation route. This novel 3D structure contained not only plenty of interconnecting macropores and mesopores, but also a large amount of irregular structure defects. The Co-4 synthesized by 0.4 M Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O concentrations solution had the largest specific surface area of 58.75 m(2) g(-1) and a average particle size of 20 nm. The optimized sample presents excellent sensing performance to NH3 gas at room temperature (RT = 21 degrees C) with the highest sensitivity (146% to 100 ppm), fast response time (2 s to 100 ppm), and a low detection limit of 0.5 ppm. Such superior properties were attributed to the unique hierarchical porous structure, large specific surface area, excellent chemisorbed ability to oxygen species and good catalytic activity of Co3O4 nanomaterials.

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were introduced into SFP scaffolds via dip-coating methods, resulting in magnetic SFP scaffolds with different strengths of magnetization. Magnetic SFP scaffolds showed excellent hyperthermia properties achieving temperature increases up to 8 degrees C in about 100 s. The scaffolds were not toxic to osteogenic cells and improved cell adhesion and proliferation. These findings suggest that tailored magnetized silk-based biomaterials can be engineered with interesting features for biomaterials and tissue-engineering applications.","4733":"Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) ceramic membranes with macroscopically aligned and hexagonally packed nanopore architecture are attractive substrates for forming nanotubular lipid bilayers as well as sorption and catalytic media because of a tunable pore diameter, robust pore structure, and low fabrication cost. Here we employed continuous wave X-band (9 GHz) EPR of two pH-sensitive nitroxide radicals to assess acid base properties AAO membranes prepared from low-cost commercial grade aluminum and compared those with commercial Anodise membranes from Whatman, Ltd. The AAO membranes with pore diameters >= 58 +\/- 8 nm showed essentially the same pH inside the pores, pH(int), as the bulk external solution, pH(ext), over the 0.1-3.0 M range of ionic strength. However, the apparent pK(a) of nitroxide probes inside the pores deviated from the bulk values for the nanopores of smaller diameters of ca. 29 and 18 nm. Specifically, for the latter nanopores the values of pHint were found to be 0.5-0.8 pH unit lower than the bulk pH(ext) An increase in acidity of the bulk solution led to a steady decrease of the negative charge on inner surface of the 38 nm nanopores and its recharge from a negative to a positive value at pH 4.7 +\/- 0.1, corresponding to the point of zero charge (pzc). Overall, the EPR titration method described here could assist in characterization of meso- and nanoporous membranes for catalytic and sorption applications as well as act a support medium for self-assembled biomembrane systems.","7387":"The potential utility of Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis in the fabrication of crosslinked chitosan was studied. Three-component crosslinking was achieved by using glyoxal and propionaldehyde to connect amine groups of chitosan via imidazolium crosslinking. A water-insoluble (at pH range of 2-10) chitosan was obtained at room temperature with a degree of substitution of 0.45 and aerogel was obtained after freeze-drying. The ability of the imidazolium-crosslinked chitosan (ICC) aerogel to absorb an anionic dye, Direct Yellow 27, from a model water was then studied. Based on the Langmuir isotherm, at a pH of 4, an adsorption maximum of 2340 mg g(-1) (3.5 mmol g(-1)) was obtained. In addition, due to the permanent cationic charge of imidazolium group, ICC exhibited excellent adsorption capacity, even under alkaline conditions. Methylglyoxal and benzaldehyde were also used to obtain other types of ICC, demonstrating the versatility of Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis for fabrication of modified chitosan.","2036":"Biomass has been utilized as an energy source for thousands of years typically in the form of wood and charcoal. Technological advances create new methodologies to extract energy and chemicals from biomass. The biomass-derived nanostructured porous carbons (BDNPCs) are the most promising sulfur hosts and interlayers in rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this article, a comprehensive review is provided in the synthesis of nanostructured porous carbon materials for high-performance rechargeable Li-S batteries by using biomass. The performances of the Li-S batteries dependent on the porous structures (micro, meso and hierarchical) from BDNPCs are discussed, which can provide an in-depth understanding and guide rational design of high-performance cathode materials by using low-cost, sustainable and natural bio-precursors. Furthermore, the current existing challenges and the future research directions for enhancing the performance of Li-S batteries by using natural biomass materials are also addressed.","7124":"In the present study, a low molecular heterocyclic aminopyrazine (Apy)-reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) hybrid coated carbon cloth (r-GO-Apy-CC) was employed as an active and stable bio-electro catalyst in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). The presence of imine (-NH-) and pyridinic (-N] C-) functional groups on the r-GO-Apy-CC electrode plays a critical role in the formation of bacterial colonization and enhanced extracellular electron transfer (EET) over a considerable period. The bacterial colonization over the r-GO-Apy-CC electrode was investigated in a Sacrificial Electrode Mode Reactor (SEMR) in which attached bacterial density with extracellular polysaccharides was monitored over a period. Simultaneously, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) reactor, resulting in an increased current density-voltage response from 0.27 mA cm(-2) to 1.84 mA cm(-2) over a period of time. In addition, when r-GO-Apy-CC was employed as an anode in MFC, the power density was nearly two times (1253 mW m(-2)) than that of the MFC employed with plain carbon cloth (PCC) (663.7 mW m(-2)) at a steady state condition. It was proposed that the combined effect of Apy hybridized with nanostructured r-GO provides a large surface area for bacterial colonization. Moreover, the high bioelectrocatalytic activity was attributed to the low molecular nature of the Apy, which incorporated well into the EET pathway of the exoelectrogens by a redox mechanism.","6333":"Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized on graphene oxide (GO), then mixed with polyethylenimine to obtain GO\/Fe3O4\/PEI nanocomposites. Due to the high surface area of GO, superparamagnetism of Fe3O4, and excellent complex ability of PEI, the nanocomposites showed extremely high Cu2+ removal efficiency. The Cu2+ removal capacity was 157 mg g(-1), which is higher than most reported results. The adsorption kinetics could be best described by a pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, GO\/Fe3O4\/PEI nanocomposites could be easily recycled by magnetic separation. After five cycles, the removal efficiency remained 84%.","2890":"Healable, electrically conductive materials are highly desirable and valuable for the development of various modern electronics. But the preparation of a material combining good mechanical elasticity, functional properties, and intrinsic self-healing ability remains a great challenge. Here, we design composites by connecting a polymer network and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through host-guest interactions. The resulting materials show bulk electrical conductivity, proximity sensitivity, humidity sensitivity and are able to self-heal without external stimulus under ambient conditions rapidly. Furthermore, they also possess elasticity comparable to commercial rubbers.","3248":"In this study, an original solvent selection method was developed for the separation of biosurfactant rhamnolipids from fermentation broth by high-speed countercurrent chromatography. For this method, calculations were based on solubility and functional group parameters that enabled the rapid selection of suitable solvent systems at no more than 10% of average time by traditional method. Based on selection results, a three-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-methyl acetate-acetonitrile-water (2:2:2:5, v\/v) was efficiently used for one-step separation of a mixture of six rhamnolipids. Thereby, RhaC(10)C(10) (0.73 mg), RhaC(10) (0.51 mg), Rha(2)C(10) (0.12 mg), RhaC(10)C(12) (1.26 mg), Rha(2)C(10)C(10) (1.03 mg), and Rha(2)C(10)C(12) (0.87 mg) were extracted from prepared Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100.0 mg) with purities of 96.37, 95.20, 91.25, 84.41, 89.8, and 90.26%, respectively. The purified compounds were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography\/mass spectroscopy, plus H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance studies. This study provides a new perspective on concepts involving efficient solvent system selection.","3165":"A combination of biomedical and technological applications is generating, over the past decades, the well established interest toward melanins and melanogenesis. Several compounds have been explored to promote\/catalyze oxidative polymerization of melanogenic precursors, such as 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA), to melanin-like biopolymers in vitro. TiO2 has shown a photocatalytic activity driving DHICA polymerization and leading to the formation of melanin-TiO2 hybrid nanostructures with unique biocide behavior even under visible light. However, the mechanism of melanin formation in those hybrids is not yet well understood although a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) process involving DHICA and Ti4+ ions was hypothesized. Here, we focus on melanin formation and apply a complementary analysis, by using photoluminescence (PL), UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to reveal the mechanism of DHICA polymerization in the presence of a TiO2-sol. This study discloses TiO2 potentialities to drive and template DHICA polymerization to melanin via LMCT-based photo-oxidative process.","7305":"The abnormally high mass-dependent isotope effects in liquid-phase hydrogen (deuterium) atom transfer reactions, which are customarily regarded as quantum effects, are actually the products of two classical effects, namely, kinetic and thermodynamic ones. The former is determined by the rate constants for atom transfer and the latter is caused by nonbonded (or noncovalent) isotope effects in the solvation of protiated and deuterated reacting molecules. This product can mimic the large isotope effects that are usually attributed to tunnelling. In enzymatic reactions, tunnelling is of particular interest; its existence characterizes an enzyme as a rigid molecular machine in which the residence time of reactants on the reaction coordinate exceeds the waiting time for the tunnelling event. The magnitude of isotope effect becomes a characteristic parameter of the internal dynamics of the enzyme catalytic site.","6889":"Ni-Doped ZnO nanofibers have been synthesized by a simple, facile electrospinning method. The structure and morphology of the products were characterized by SEM, HRTEM and XRD analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that Ni2+ ions exist in the ZnO nanofiber structures. The photoelectric gas-sensing tests reveal that the response was significantly enhanced by Ni doping, and the 0.7% molar ratio Ni-doped sample (NZ0.7) exhibits the highest response of 532.7% to 100 ppm HCHO at room temperature. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that there are more donors in Ni-doped ZnO nanofibers by the introduction of Ni2+ ions. Furthermore, the surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) tests indicated that Ni doping can effectively enhance the donor density, which could facilitate charge separation and transport in the semiconductor, and promote photogenerated holes to move toward the irradiated surface of the samples. These results contribute to the photocatalytic oxidation of HCHO so as to achieve higher gas-sensing properties for Ni-doped ZnO nanofibers.","4237":"Herein, we demonstrate that a very familiar, yet underutilized, physical parametergas pressurecan serve as signal readout for highly sensitive bioanalysis. Integration of a catalyzed gas-generation reaction with a molecular recognition component leads to significant pressure changes, which can be measured with high sensitivity using a low-cost and portable pressure meter. This new signaling strategy opens up a new way for simple, portable, yet highly sensitive biomedical analysis in a variety of settings.","2280":"The use of computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) in material design has attracted considerable attention aimed at achieving efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A series of novel (2Z)-2-cyano-2-[2-[(E)-2-[5-[(E)-2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)vinyl]-2-thienyl]vinyl]pyran-4-ylidene]acetic acid derivatives were simulated using DFT and time-dependent DFT for calculations of molecular properties, electronic properties, optical properties, population analysis, global reactivity indices and light harvesting efficiency (LHE). The results showed that incorporation of an F\/CH3 substituent on the acceptor unit increased\/decreased the charge density on the acceptor unit, thereby increasing\/lowering its tendency to accept electrons from the donor unit through a pi-conjugated linker due to the electron-withdrawing\/electron-donating effect of F\/CH3; this ultimately increased\/decreased the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy band gap (E-g). The para-amino substituents on the donor unit drastically increased the natural bond orbital (NBO) charges of both the donor and acceptor units of the dyes, i.e. para-CH3 < para-NH2 < para-N(CH3)(2); this agreed well with the ordering of the band gap. Generally, dyes with para-N(CH3)(2) on the donor subunit have longer light absorption wavelengths, a low E-g and a high LHE, which could lead to enhancement of the photocurrent and charge transfer in DSSCs.","4631":"The magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) is known to belong to a class of smart materials whose elastic properties can be varied by an externally applied magnetic field. In addition to the property of the field-dependent stiffness change of the MRE, the electrical resistance of the composite is also changed by the induced strain, thereby providing a new self-sensing feature. In the present study, a novel, dynamic vibration absorber is developed using an MRE with a self-sensing function and adaptability. The natural frequency of the absorber is instantaneously tuned to a dominant frequency extracted from the strain signal of MRE. The damping performance test shows that the vibration of a system with one degree-of-freedom that is exposed to a nonstationary disturbance can be adequately reduced by the proposed frequency-tunable dynamic absorber without the use of external sensors.","2291":"A synergistic strategy of point defects and microstructure engineering has been proposed and demonstrated in this work to regulate the electrical and thermal transport properties of chalcopyrite CuInTe2 based TE materials: on one hand, the power factor increases greatly by dissolving ZnTe into the CuInTe2 matrix, leading to an order of magnitude increase of carrier concentration due to the preferential formation of acceptor-like defects Zn-In(-), meanwhile, the formation of defect pair verified by binding energy calculation insures a less reduction in mobility at high ZnTe content; on the other hand, the thermal conductivity lowers sharply by adding an appropriate content of TiO2 nanopowders, which react with the matrix and result in a wide spectrum phonon scattering by the integrated point defects, In2O3 nanoparticles, stacking faults and grain boundaries. As a consequence, a great enhancement of ZTwith a maximum of 1.47 at 823 K has been achieved in the (CuInTe2)(0.99)(2ZnTe)(0.01) with 0.1 wt% TiO2 nanofibers sample, which can be a suitable p-type candidate to couple with other high performance n-type materials for middle temperature TE power generation.

Part 1: Different ways to associate metal oxides and polysaccharides. Part 2: Controlled growth of metal oxide nanoparticles throughout polysaccharide fibers. Part 3: Biotemplating and bio-replication on the microto nanoscale. Part 4: Chemical transformation of polysaccharide fibers by mineralisation. Perspectives and concluding remarks. Biopolymers and inorganic minerals are often associated in nature, and living organisms benefit from these materials with a sophisticated and hierarchical architecture. Inspired by nature, chemists have tried to extend these combinations by associating natural polymers with inorganic materials that do not occur naturally in living organisms. In this review, we propose to focus only on research conducted on the association between polysaccharides and metal oxides. Over the last 10-15 years, substantial research has been focused on finding ways to combine these two types of materials, with the goal of mastering the morphology, porosity, composition and structure of the hybrid materials (metal oxide@polysaccharide) or pure metal oxides obtained after polysaccharide elimination. There are many possibilities for interactions between metal cations and the chemical functionality of the carbohydrate, thus allowing different approaches, as the structure and functionality of the polysaccharide are of major importance. Because of the sophisticated architecture that can be achieved on the one hand, and the potential sustainable use of these biopolymers (a green approach) on the other hand, these material elaboration processes offer a unique way for chemists to prepare functional hybrid materials and metal oxides (e.g. luminescent materials, catalysts, absorbent materials, magnetic composites, anode and photocatalyst materials). To be as comprehensive as possible, this review is limited to some natural polysaccharides. After contextualisation, we successively considered metal oxide growth control by biotemplating, the replication of raw and refined polysaccharide templates, ending with a discussion of the most recent approaches like mineralisation.","3442":"Water permeability and transient water sorption data in human and porcine stratum corneum (SC) are analyzed in conjunction with equilibrium water sorption data and a dynamic skin swelling model to develop a quantitative model for water diffusivity in the SC as a function of its water content. The recommended function (model 1) is phenomenological and treats the SC as a uniform, swellable slab. This approach yields satisfactory agreement with experimental data over a wide range of RH and associated equilibrium SC water content, C-u,. It is supported by two alternative approaches. Model 2 considers the SC to be a multilaminate membrane consisting of alternating lipid and protein layers. Diffusivity in the protein phase is estimated from water diffusivity in other keratinized tissues, whereas diffusivity in the lipid phase is assumed to be linearly related to the swelling strain on intercellular lipids. Model 3 uses an analysis previously suggested by Stockdale to rationalize transepidermal water loss data in humans over a wide range of relative humidity. All models yield similar results for 0.20 <= C-w <= 0.78 g\/cm(3), the usual range of SC water content in vivo. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work investigates their ability to extract an organic analyte, capsaicin, from fresh Capsicum annuum Bird's eye chilli peppers (also known as Thai chillies), followed by the electroanalytical quantification of the extracted analyte. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was also extracted and quantified. Two ionic liquids were identified to extract capsaicin from fresh chilli more effectively than the conventional ethanol-based process; the inherently basic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [Emim][OAc], and the inherently acidic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, [Emim][HSO4]. The ionic liquid extracts could be electrochemically quantified using a bare glassy carbon electrode either in the pure ionic liquid (one pot extraction and quantification) or after dilution with water\/ethanol to assist resolution of the capsaicin (flavour indicator) and ascorbic acid (freshness indicator) features.","3910":"The new modified electrodebased on Meldola Blue (MB) adsorbed onto carbon aerogel (CA) incorporated into chitosan matrix and deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) disc were used for NADH electrocatalytic oxidation. MB was immobilized by simple adsorption on mesoporous CA (MBCA) and was immobilized on a GC disc using chitosan matrix. The morphological and structural characteristics of the new electrode material such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, pore volume, were obtained from N-2 adsorption - desorption isotherms and TEM measurements. The basic electrochemistry of adsorbed MB onto CA and its ability to catalyze NADH electrooxidation have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disc electrode performed in different experimental conditions (potential scan rate, rotation speed, applied potential, NADH concentration, MB coverage). The electrocatalytic parameters of the investigated MB-CA\/GC modified electrodes were estimated.","1514":"Excessive visible light exposure can induce damage to retinal cells and contribute to the development or progression of age-related macular degeneration. In this study we created a model of phototoxicity in pigmented rabbits. Furthermore, we investigated the protective effect of bilberry anthocyanin extract (BAE, Table A1) and explored the possible mechanisms of action in this model. The model of light-induced retinal damage was established by the pigmented rabbits exposed to light at 18,000 lx for 2 h, and they were sacrificed on day 7. After administration of BAE at dosages of 250 and 500 mg\/kg\/day, retinal dysfunction was significantly inhibited in terms of electroretinograms, and the decreased thicknesses of retinal outer nuclear layer and lengths of the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells were suppressed in rabbits with retinal degeneration. BAE attenuated the changes caused by light to certain apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3). The extract increased the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, as well as the total antioxidant capacity, but decreased the malondialdehyde level in the retinal cells. BAE inhibited the light-induced elevation in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenic parameters (IL-1 and VEGF). Results showed that visible light-induced retinal degeneration model in pigmented rabbits was successfully established and BAE exhibited protective effects by increasing the antioxidant defense mechanisms, suppressing lipid peroxidation and proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibiting retinal cells apoptosis.","4368":"Host-guest assembly in droplet-based microfluidics opens a new avenue for fabricating supramolecular hydrogel microcapsules with high monodispersity and controlled functionality. In this paper, we demonstrate a single emulsion microdroplet platform to prepare microcapsules with supramolecular hydrogel skins from host molecule cucurbit[8]uril and guest polymer anthracene-functionalized hydroxyethyl cellulose. In contrast to construction of microcapsules from a droplet-in-droplet double emulsion, here the electrostatic attraction between charged polymer and surfactant facilitates formation of defined supramolecular hydrogel skins in a single emulsion. Furthermore, by taking advantage of dynamic interactions and the tunable cross-linked supramolecular hydrogel network, it is possible to prepare microcapsules with triggered and UV-controlled molecular permeability. These could be potentially used in a delivery system for e.g. agrochemicals, nutraceuticals or cosmetics.","6764":"10-Hydroxycamptothecin (CPT) is considered as one of the most promising anticancer drugs against a broad spectrumof human cancers. However, it is difficult to apply CPT clinically, because of its poor water solubility and reversible instability between the active lactone and inactive carboxylate forms at neutral pH. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, the active lactone form of CPT-soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) complex self-assembled nanoparticles (CPT-SPC NPs) is prepared by a co-solvent method combined with a self-assembly technique. The CPT-SPC complex is characterized by solubility, UV-vis, H-1 NMR, FTIR, XRD, and fluorescence analysis. These results prove the efficient complexation between active lactone form of CPT and SPC (complexation rate was high as approximately 98%). The self-assembled CPT-SPC NPs show a hydrodynamic particle size of 210.7 +\/- 6.1 nm, a zeta potential of -24.9 +\/- 3.1 mV, a spherical shape, and a high drug-loading content of 16.3 +\/- 0.5%. CPT is released from the CPT-SPC NPs in a biphasic way with an initial burst release followed by a subsequent sustained release. Additionally, in comparision with the free CPT, the CPT-SPC NPs, because of the improved drug stability and enhanced drug transport across cellular membranes, present significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency and cell-killing effect of the drug. Moreover, both confocal imaging and fluorescence measurements demonstrate that CPT is able to be delivered to nuclei by the CPT-SPC NPs after their cellular uptake, by real-time monitoring of drug release and intracellular drug delivery. Furthermore, in vivo animal imaging results indicate that the systemically administered CPT-SPC NPs exhibit excellent tumor targetability in HeLa tumor-bearing nude mice. These results demonstrate that the CPT-SPC complex-based self-assembled NPs hold great potential as effective drug delivery systems for cancer treatment.","500":"In this paper a biosensor modified by ordered mesoporous carbon-chitosan (OMC-CS)\/ferroferric eoxide-chitosan (Fe3O4-CS) was developed on the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was modified onto the film to prepare an AChE biosensor. Chitosan was used as a dispersant to disperse OMC and Fe3O4. The OMC and Fe3O4 were used to enhance the electrochemical response. Before the detection of organophosphorus (OP) pesticides, the electrochemical behaviour of AChE\/OMC-CS\/Fe3O4-CS\/SPCE was studied with cyclic voltammetry, and the results showed that the chitosan can disperse OMC and Fe3O4 evenly and fix them on the electrode surface firmly. OMC and Fe3O4 have a significant synergistic effect towards electron transfer. The parameters affecting performance, such as the pH of the test solution, the amount of AChE and the time of inhibition have been optimized. Under optimum conditions, using methamidophos and chlorpyrifos as model compounds, this biosensor showed a wide range, low detection limit, good reproducibility and high stability. Moreover, the AChE\/OMC-CS\/Fe3O4-CS\/SPCE biosensor can be used for the detection of real samples, and is suitable for field testing of OP pesticide residues.","437":"We study the dielectric relaxation in paper of different density and in microcrystalline cellulose in a temperature range between 150 K and 350 K. Qualitatively the spectra display the same relaxations alpha, beta, gamma. An additional relaxation, beta(wet), is found in humidified samples. The adsorption of water is determined and related to the humidity of the surrounding. Two adsorption processes are identified as primary and secondary adsorption at the hydroxyl groups in the amorphous domains of the cellulose. The g process in the dielectric spectrum is found to be directly related to the amount of water adsorbed in the sample. While qualitatively the differences to unprocessed, microcrystalline cellulose are negligible, quantitatively the less localised beta-relaxation shows an increased relaxation strength induced by the geometrical confinement and orientation effects due to the processing into cellulose fibres. While the manufacturing process leads to paper with different density and porosity there is no significant change in water uptake, structure or dynamics.","3891":"Stabilizing lithium polysulfides in cathodes via interactions between polysulfides and affinitive functional groups could prevent polysulfide dissolution, leading to suppressed \"shuttle effect\" of lithium\/sulfur (Li\/S) batteries. Herein, four deoxynucleotides (DNs), including A (adenine-DN), T (thymine-DN), G (guanine-DN), and C (cytosine-DN), which own rich polysulfide affinitive groups, are selected to model the anchoring environments of polysulfides. Using the most soluble Li2S8 as probe, our first-principles simulations suggest that the interactions between polysulfides and substrates are highly correlated to the charges of affinitive sites, H-bonding environments and structural tension. The contributions from each type of interactions are quasi-quantitatively assessed. The electrostatic attractions between Li+ and the strong electron lone-pairs dominate the adsorption energetics, while the H-bonds formed between S-8(2-) and substrate give rise to excessive stabilization. In contrast, structural distortion or rearrangement of the substrates is detrimental to the anchoring strengths. The quasi-quantitative resolution on the different interaction modes provides a facile and rational scheme for screening more efficient polysufide affinitive additives to sustain the cathode cyclicity of Li\/S batteries.","3254":"Electrostatic repulsion, long used for attenuating surface friction(1,2), is not typically employed for the design of bulk structural materials. We recently developed a hydrogel(3) with a layered structure consisting of cofacially oriented electrolyte nanosheets(4). Because this unusual geometry imparts a large anisotropic electrostatic repulsion(5) to the hydrogel interior, the hydrogel resisted compression orthogonal to the sheets but readily deformed along parallel shear. Building on this concept, here we show a hydrogel actuator(6-11) that operates by modulating its anisotropic electrostatics(12) in response to changes of electrostatic permittivity associated with a lower critical solution temperature transition(3,14). In the absence of substantial water uptake and release, the distance between the nanosheets rapidly expands and contracts on heating and cooling, respectively, so that the hydrogel lengthens and shortens significantly, even in air. An L-shaped hydrogel with an oblique nanosheet configuration can thus act as a unidirectionally proceeding actuator that operates without the need for external physical biases(15-18).","5533":"4-(2,4-Dinitrophenoxy)-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (DPE-I) and (4-(2,4-dinitrophenoxy)-3-methoxyphenyl) methanol (DPE-II) were synthesized with high yield and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. The complexation behaviours of DPE-I and DPE-II for various cationic species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) in HEPES buffered CH3CN : H2O system were investigated and compared by spectroscopic and voltammetric techniques. Both receptors showed high degree of selectivity for Fe3+ over other cations. Receptors showed 1 : 1 complexation with Fe3+. DPE-I showed fluorescence quenching on complexation with Fe3+ ion at 350 nm due to PET (photon induced transfer) mechanism between Fe3+ and the large pi electron conjugate system of ligand, while DPE-II displayed emission band at 314 nm which underwent fluorescence quenching selectively on gradual addition of Fe3+ at 314 nm and simultaneously a new band at 424 nm emerged with isosbestic point at 355 nm which increases with increase in Fe3+ conc. Electrochemically, DPE-I due to presence of electron withdrawing (aldehydic group) facilitates reduction of nitro group on benzene ring of the molecule so, peak potentials of the two curves obtained for DPE-I appear at -1.16 V (E-pc1) and -1.39 V (E-pc2) respectively, while in DPE-II (methanolic group) due to its electron donating character makes the reduction of nitro group a little difficult due to which peak potentials occur at higher potential as compared to DPE-I i.e. at -1.30 V (E-pc1) and -1.43 V (E-pc2) respectively.","1616":"Porous calcium phosphate microspheres have been modified to contain nanoparticles of silver to provide both osteoconductive and antimicrobial components to implant coatings. These microspheres have been mixed with chitosan and bonded to titanium via alkyloxysilane reaction. Silver concentration on calcium phosphate microspheres was varied from 0 to 50% and microspheres were loaded at 30 wt.% within chitosan coatings. Increasing concentrations of silver loaded on calcium phosphate microspheres within the chemically bound coating reduces bacterial viability by up to 90% in both anaerobic and aerobic pathogenic microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. This novel coating could reduce the incidence of infection in orthopaedic and dental implant applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In comparison with PSCs based on untreated TiO2, PSC devices based on H-TiO2 exhibit a significantly greater photovoltaic performance with a solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of over 13%. A 15.79% increase in J(sc) (17.29 mA cm(-2) to 20.02 mA cm(-2)) was observed in PSCs based on TiO2 and H-TiO2 nanopowders, and also there is a slight amplification of the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) from 0.92 V to 0.97 V. The H-TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit a broader absorption band in the visible wavelength range, the donor density is increased and the band potential is shifted positively, which yield the enhanced driving force for electron injection thus elevating the current density of the PSCs. Moreover, it is elucidated that the electron behavior of the H-TiO2 nanocrystals can prolong the photogenerated charge lifetime, slow down the recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs and elevate the photoinduced charge separation efficiency through surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) and transient photovoltage measurement (TPV).","80":"We describe a novel strategy to fabricate a well-defined polydiacetylene (PDA) supramolecular pattern on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane utilizing a DNA bio-photomask. By focusing on that, the absorption spectrum of DNA molecules having a lambda(max) at 260 nm overlaps with the wavelength at which the photopolymerization of the diacetylene monomer occurs, DNA molecules are used to define specific patterns on PVDF membranes coated with diacetylene lipids by shielding the applied 254 nm UV light and consequently preventing the photopolymerization of the lipids. As a result, the DNA-covered regions retain the original white color on the membrane while the regions uncovered by DNA molecules undergo the color change to blue through the photopolymerization by 254 nm UV irradiation. On the basis of the selective illumination through a DNA photomask, we precisely manufacture specific patterns using a microarray spotting method and also demonstrate the capability of this strategy to achieve a novel colorimetric DNA sensor without any complicated process.","4710":"DNA-immobilized Fe3O4 particles (DNA-Fe-particles) were prepared by mixing DNA, magnetic Fe3O4 particles, and the silane coupling reagent, bis[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] amine. The DNA-inorganic hybrid material was uniformly immobilized onto magnetic Fe3O4 particles with the diameters of approximately 450 nm. These DNA-Fe-particles were stable in water. Additionally, we could simply collect the DNA-Fe-particles by a magnet from an aqueous solution. Therefore, we demonstrated the accumulation of various metal ions, such as heavy and rare-earth metal ions, by the DNA-Fe-particles. As a result, although these DNA-Fe-particles could selectively accumulate heavy and rare-earth metal ions, these materials could not accumulate the light metal ions, such as Mg(II) and Ca(II) ions. Furthermore, the metal ion-accumulated DNA-Fe-particles could be recycled by washing them with an aqueous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution.","4641":"Low-voltage transparent indium-free aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) are demonstrated by using chitosan polymer electrolyte as the gate dielectric. Chitosan with a large specific capacitance (0.4 mu F\/cm(2)) is obtained possibly due to the strong electric-double-layer (EDL) effect through the mobile-proton hopping mechanism. Herein, low-cost indium-free AZO film is developed for replacing the traditional ITO\/IZO electrodes. A simple method is developed to fabricate all of the channel and source\/drain electrodes during one-step sputter process by using such a low-cost indium-free AZO film. The optimized TFTs with 30 nm AZO thickness shows the best performance with a low operation voltage of 1.5 V, a large on-off ratio of 10(5), and a field-effect mobility of 8.3 cm(2)\/Vs, respectively.

Here we generate a variety of such polyelectrolytes with various cationic moieties and counterion combinations starting from a common polymeric platform. We show that the rheological properties ( shear modulus, critical strain) of the final hydrogels can be modulated over three orders of magnitude depending on the cation\/anion pair. Our data fit remarkably well within a scaling model involving a supramolecular head-to-tail single file between cross-links, akin to the behaviour of pine-processionary caterpillar. This model allows the quantitative measure of the amount of counterion condensation from standard rheology procedure.","5340":"Polymer coatings with various pH values and containing cellulose nanofibers and a corrosion inhibitor were applied to carbon steels for corrosion inhibition. The polarization resistance of scratches made to the prepared coatings was measured in a corrosive solution. The resistance of the scratched coatings was largely dependent on the pH of the polymer. The scratched polymer coating prepared at pH 11.4 showed a drastic increase in polarization resistance just after immersion, and was the highest measured after a 24 h corrosion test. A corrosion-protective film was formed on the scratched portion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) were used to characterize the chemical structure and the residual non-rubber component. A rheology study and stress relaxation measurements were used to study the role that non-rubber components play in natural networks. A rheological study showed that natural rubber (NR) and deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) exhibited similar dynamic modulus at 170 degrees C. The lack of superposition in van Gurp-Palmen (vGP) curves at different temperatures for NR and DPNR, together with the shape of vGP curves, proved that long chain branching was mainly constructed by phospholipids. Stress relaxation measurements at room temperature were fitted with the Maxwell model and showed that the NR relaxation curve underwent a quick decrease and then came to an equilibrium stress retention of 58%, which is about 3 times higher than that of DPNR, indicating that proteins in NR contributed to the network structure at room temperature. Combining molecular dynamic studies, the interaction of proteins and phospholipids in non-rubber networks was proposed.","6392":"Activated carbons (ACs) are actively researched as electrode materials for supercapacitors and there is a significant interest to produce ACs from sustainable and low cost precursors. In this study, various ACs were prepared from hydrothermally carbonized sugars by KOH activation. Both the hydrothermal carbonization and activation processes were optimized to tailor the properties (e.g. textural properties, chemical composition, N-doping, electrical conductivity) of the ACs. For instance, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (S-BET) were tuned in the range of 800-3000 m(2) g(-1) with associated variation in the extent of microporosity and pore size distributions (PSDs). The ACs were evaluated electrochemically as materials for supercapacitor electrodes in a symmetrical two-electrode cell using an aqueous electrolyte. The relationship between the electrochemical, textural, electrical, and physicochemical properties were analyzed systematically to understand the key factors determining the electrochemical performance. A high specific capacitance (C-m) of similar to 260 F g(-1) was achieved at a moderately high S-BET of similar to 1300 m(2) g(-1), which was equivalent to a C-m\/S-BET of 20 mu F cm(-2), for an optimal AC prepared from hydrothermally carbonized glucose. The very high surface-specific capacitance highlights that the specific surface area is certainly not the sole limiting parameter for effective electrode materials.","5434":"Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology to supply deionized water as liquid coolant for the thermal management in microelectronics. Graphene has been demonstrated as a promising candidate for CDI electrode. However, the performance of current graphene-based CD! is far below expectation due to the limited specific surface area (SSA) and electrical conductivity of the chemically reduced graphene. Here we presented a KOH-activated graphene that has ultrahigh SSA of 3513 m(2)\/g and electrical conductivity of 104 S\/m. With improved materials properties, an ultrahigh electrosorption capacity of 11.86 mg\/g and a significant adsorption rate of 20 min are achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Both brittle cracking and ductile failure have been observed in scaffolds with similarly random fibrous morphology. Finite element analysis can be used to qualitatively examine the mechanics of these differing failure mechanisms. The finite element modeling demonstrates that the noncontinuum deformation of the network structure results in fiber bundle formation and material toughening. Such toughening is accommodated by varying fiber properties, including allowing large failure strains and progressive damage of the fibers.

Spherical-like magnetic gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 17 nm displayed well superparamagnetic behavior and were chemically bonded to the bamboo surface through the combination of hydrogen groups. With further modification by 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoroclecyltri ethoxysilane (FAS-17), magnetic gamma-Fe2O3\/bamboo composites (MBCs) expressed superhydrophobic performances to not only water but also common liquids like coffee, milk, ink, tea, and coke. When immersed into the corrosive solutions including strong acid (pH 1), heavy alkaline (pH 14), and salt with high concentration (5 M) for 24 h, superhydrophobic magnetic gamma-Fe2O3\/bamboo composites (SMBC) still remained magnetism as well as superhydrophobicity. Also, under harsh conditions like boiled at 100 degrees C for 4 h, frozen at 40 degrees C for 24 h, SMBCs were kept a robust magnetism and superhydrophobicity. Additionally, SMBC was a typical ferromagnet and exhibited some microwave absorbabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

CZHF is fabricated by simply blending ZnO nanoparticles with cellulose solution prepared by dissolving cotton pulp with lithium chloride\/N, N-dimethylacetamide solvent. After curing in isopropyl alcohol and water mixture, the CZHF is obtained. The enzyme glucose oxidase is immobilised into the CZHF by physical adsorption method. The enzyme activity of the glucose biosensor increases as the ZnO weight ratio increases linearly. The CZHF can detect glucose in the range of 1-12 mM.","3143":"A new nanocomposite, poly(aniline-co-diphenylamine- 4-sulfonic acid)\/graphene (PANISP\/rGO), was prepared by means of an in situ oxidation copolymerization of aniline (ANI) with diphenylamine-4-sulfonic acid (SP) in the presence of graphene oxide, followed by the chemical reduction of graphene oxide using hydrazine hydrate as a reductant. The morphology and structure of PANISP\/rGO were characterized by field-emission (FE) SEM, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, FTIR, and UV\/Vis spectra. The electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impe-dance spectroscopy. The PANISP\/rGO nanocomposite showed a nanosized structure, with sulfonic polyaniline nanoarrays coated homogeneously on the surface of graphene nanosheets. This special structure of the nanocomposite also facilitates the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. The PANISP\/rGO nanocomposite exhibits a specific supercapacitance up to 1170 Fg(-1) at the current density of 0.5 Ag-1. The as-prepared electrodes show excellent supercapacitive performance because of the synergistic effects between graphene and the sulfonic polyaniline copolymer chains.","2570":"The most important aspect of synthetic lipid membrane architectures is their ability to study functional membrane-active peptides and membrane proteins in an environment close to nature. Here, we report on the generation and performance of a biomimetic platform, the S-layer supported lipid membrane (SsLM), to investigate the structural and electrical characteristics of the membrane-active peptide gramicidin and the transmembrane protein alpha-hemolysin in real-time using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring in combination with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A shift in membrane resistance is caused by the interaction of alpha-hemolysin and gramicidin with SsLMs, even if only an attachment onto, or functional channels through the lipid membrane, respectively, are formed. Moreover, the obtained results did not indicate the formation of functional alpha-hemolysin pores, but evidence for functional incorporation of gramicidin into this biomimetic architecture is provided.","3945":"Electrospun carbon nanofibres (CNFs) containing CNTs were produced by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. This material was evaluated as a bioelectrode for biofuel cell applications after covalent grafting of laccase. Bis-pyrene-modified ABTS was used as a plug to wire laccase to the nanofibres leading to a maximum current density of 100 mu A cm(-2).","4092":"Most antimicrobial peptides act upon target microorganisms by permeabilizing their membranes. The mode of action is often assessed by vesicle leakage experiments that use model membranes, with the assumption that biological activity correlates with the permeabilization of the lipid bilayer. The current work aims to extend the interpretation of vesicle leakage results and examine the correlation between vesicle leakage and antimicrobial activity. To this end, we used a lifetime-based leakage assay with calcein-loaded vesicles to study the membrane permeabilizing properties of a novel antifungal polymer poly-NM, two of its analogs, and a series of detergents. In conjunction, the biological activities of these compounds against Candida albicans were assessed and correlated with data from vesicle leakage. Poly-NM induces all-or-none leakage in polar yeast lipid vesicles at the polymer's MIC, 3 mu g mL(-1). At this and higher concentrations, complete leakage after an initial lag time was observed. Concerted activity tests imply that this polymer acts independently of the detergent octyl glucoside (OG) for both vesicle leakage and activity against C. albicans spheroplasts. In addition, poly-NM was found to have negligible activity against zwitterionic vesicles and red blood cells. Our results provide a consistent, detailed picture of the mode of action of poly-NM: this polymer induces membrane leakage by electrostatic lipid clustering. In contrast, poly-MM: CO, a nylon-3 polymer comprised of both cationic and hydrophobic segments, seems to act by a different mechanism that involves membrane asymmetry stress. Vesicle leakage for this polymer is transient (limited to <100%) and graded, non-specific among zwitterionic and polar yeast lipid vesicles, additive with detergent action, and correlates poorly with biological activity. Based on these results, we conclude that comprehensive leakage experiments can provide a detailed description of the mode of action of membrane permeabilizing compounds. Without this thorough approach, it would have been logical to assume that the two nylon-3 polymers we examined act via similar mechanisms; it is surprising that their mechanisms are so distinct. Some, but not all mechanisms of vesicle permeabilization allow for antimicrobial activity.","6888":"The floral variant of mesoporous carbon was simply prepared by direct pyrolysis of zinc citrate followed by washing with dilute hydrochloric acid. The unique floral microstructure endows the carbon with ultrahigh reversible capacity, excellent cycle stability and superior rate performance as an anode material for both sodium ion batteries and lithium ion batteries. The floral variant of mesoporous carbon exhibits a reversible sodium storage capacity as high as 438.5 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 30 mA g(-1) and retains a value of 68.7 mA h g(-1) at an enhanced current density of 10 A g(-1). Moreover, the floral mesoporous carbon can deliver a tremendous reversible capacity up to 1370 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) as an anode for lithium ion batteries. It can output a high reversible capacity of 222 mA h g(-1) even when being charged and discharged at 50 A g(-1). Based on the astounding capacity and rate performance, the floral variant of mesoporous carbon can be regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for both sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries.","3909":"This review highlights the recent developments made, during the past five years, from 2010 onwards, in biosensors that bring together the advantages of the layer-by-layer (LbL) methodology and the use of graphene and carbon nanotubes as carbon nanomaterials. LbL methodology in biosensor assembly has been widely used to incorporate suitable materials with controlled molecular architecture, enabling the build-up of stable and complex architectures. At the same time, the incorporation of nano-sized materials into a sensing device has been exploited in order to improve the electronic communication between the enzyme and the electrode substrate. The advantages of incorporating carbon nanomaterials (CN) into LbL multilayers for the development of biosensors with improved analytical performance are described. The key steps for the incorporation of CN in self assembled architectures are the choice of the type of CN functionalization and pairing with an adequate oppositely-charged polyelectrolyte. The preparation of the LbL assembly will be described in detail. Electrochemical and surface characterization will underline the importance of incorporating CN and identify their nanostructures and build-up in the LbL assembly. Finally, applications of CN-LbL biosensors will exemplify their utility as analytical tools for the detection of key analytes, such as glucose, ethanol, cholesterol and neurotoxins.","534":"Silicon was selectively removed from a silicon carbonitride (SiCN) aerogel by hot chlorine gas treatment, leading to a N-doped carbon aerogel (N-CDC aerogel). The combined effects of pyrolysis and etching temperature were studied with regard to the change in the composition of the material after etching as well as the microstructure of the produced hierarchically porous material. Upon removal of Si from amorphous SiCN, carbon and nitrogen, which are not bonded together in the starting material, react, creating new C-N bonds. The removal of silicon also gives rise to a high amount of micropores and hence a high specific surface area, which can be beneficial for the functionality of the carbonaceous material produced. The mesoporous structure of the aerogel allows us to complete the etching at low temperature, which was found to be a crucial parameter to maintain a high amount of nitrogen in the material. The combination of a high amount of micropores and the mesopore transport system is beneficial for adsorption processes due to the combination of a high amount of adsorption sites and effective transport properties of the material. The N-CDC aerogels were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetry (TG\/DTA), and infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) and they were evaluated as CO2 absorbers and as electrodes for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).","6107":"This paper reports the direct transformation of raw lignocellulosic biomass into nanostructured graphitic carbon in a single step. Catalytic iron carbide nanoparticles are generated in situ by thermal decomposition of absorbed iron nitrate followed by carbothermal reduction. The Fe3C particles then etch through the biomass to generate intertwined graphitic tubules through catalytic graphitization. The materials are mesoporous with the pore size dependant on the iron content. Conversion of raw biomass into stable graphitic carbon at relatively low temperatures (800 degrees C) offers a promising route to large-scale and sustainable synthesis of carbons for electrode or filtration applications. This facile method can also be used to produce nanocomposites of Fe3C\/graphite combined with nanoparticles of metal oxides such as CaO or MgO, again from a one-pot precursor, giving potential for a wide range of applications.","748":"Scutellariae radix, the root of Scutellaria baicalensis, has long been applied in traditional formulations and modern herbal medications. Propionibacterium acnes (P.acnes) in follicles can trigger inflammation and lead to the symptom of inflammatory acnes vulgaris. This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of Scutellariae radix extract and purified components isolated from it on inflammation induced by P.acnes in vitro and in vivo. The results showed the ethyl acetate (EA) soluble fraction from the partition of crude ethanolic extract from Scutellariae radix inhibited P.acnes-induced interleukin IL-8 and IL-1 production in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Seven flavones were isolated from the EA fraction by repeated chromatographies, and identified as 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone (FL1, oroxylin), 5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (FL2, wogonin), 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone (FL3, 7-O-methylwogonin), 5,6-dihydroxy-6,7,8,2-tetramethoxy flavone (FL4, skullcapflavone II), 5,7,4-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (FL5), 5,2,6-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone (FL6, viscidulin II), and 5,7,2,5-tetrahydroxy-8,6-dimethoxyflavone (FL7, ganhuangenin). They all significantly suppressed P. acnes-induced IL-8 and IL-1 production in THP-1 cells, and FL2 exerted the strongest effect with half maximal inhibition (IC50) values of 8.7 and 4.9 M, respectively. Concomitant intradermal injection of each of the seven flavones (20 g) with P. acnes effectively attenuated P. acnes-induced ear swelling, and decreased the production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- in ear homogenates. Our results suggested that all the seven flavones can be potential therapeutic agents against P. acnes-induced skin inflammation.","811":"A tough aerogel electrode of manganese oxide and polyaniline was prepared by insitu gelation, freeze-drying, and heat treatment on carbon cloth. The porous structure endows the final aerogel electrode with high electrochemical performance even at high current density and excellent cycling stability.","908":"Stimuli-responsive hydrogels are becoming increasingly important for controlled drug delivery, biosensing, and tissue engineering. However, few pH-sensitive hydrogels with good mechanical property have been extensively reported. In this investigation, we reported the preparation of extremely stretchable and tough pH-sensitive hydrogels by introducing a linear polysaccharide-agar into the poly(acrylamide-coacrylic acid) (P(AM-co-AA)) network and using diacrylated PEG (PEGDA) as a chemical crosslinker based on a simultaneous interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) structure. It was found that longer PEGDA chains would lead to the obvious increase in swelling ratio and the stretchability of hydrogels. Moreover, the content of agar, the crosslinker concentration and the pH of the external environment would significantly affect the mechanical characteristics of the hydrogels. The compression strength and dissipated energy could reach 4.56 MPa and 0.56 MJ m(-3) under the deformation of 85%, respectively. Also, hydrogels exhibited excellent reversible swelling and recoverable deformation. The improved mechanical properties enable the pH-sensitive hydrogels to be potential candidates in the field of loadbearing soft tissues.","585":"Nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped three dimensional (3D) graphene aerogels (N-S-GAs) are firstly prepared through pyrolyzing poly[5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol] coated graphene aerogels (PATT-GAs) as a metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. 3D structures of N-S-GAs have been reserved after high temperature pyrolyzing, and N and S atoms are successfully doped into graphene frameworks. The catalytic performance of the fabricated N-S-GAs towards the ORR is assessed by electrochemical test techniques. The effects of pyrolyzing temperature on catalytic activity are also studied. The binding states of N and S atoms have a great influence on the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. The N-S-GAs gained after pyrolysis at 900 degrees C (N-S-GAs 900) demonstrate higher electrocatalytic activity and diffusion-limiting current density, better stability and methanol tolerance. The excellent performance for the ORR on N-S-GAs is attributed to the interconnected porous network, conductive multiplexed pathways of N-S-GAs, greater electrocatalytically active site exposure and the synergistic effect originating from the doped N and S in the graphene sheets.","856":"The programmability of oligonucleotide hybridization offers an attractive platform for the design of assemblies with emergent properties or functions. Developments in DNA nanotechnologies have transformed our thinking about the applications of nucleic acids. Progress from designed assemblies to functional outputs will continue to benefit from functionalities added to the nucleic acids that can participate in reactions or interactions beyond hybridiation. In that respect, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are interesting because they combine the hybridization properties of DNA with the modularity of peptides. In fact, PNAs form more stable duplexes with DNA or RNA than the corresponding natural homoduplexes. The high stability achieved with shorter oligomers (an 8-mer is sufficient for a stable duplex at room temperature) typically results in very high sequence fidelity in the hybridization with negligible impact of the ionic strength of the buffer due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the duplex strands. The simple peptidic backbone of PNA has been shown to be tolerant of modifications with substitutions that further enhance the duplex stability while providing opportunities for functionalization. Moreover, the metabolic stability of PNAs facilitates their integration into systems that interface with biology. Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in using PNAs as biosupramolecular tags to program assemblies and reactions. A series of robust templated reactions have been developed with functionalized PNA. These reactions can be used to translate DNA templates into functional polymers of unprecedented complexity, fluorescent outputs, or bioactive small molecules. Furthermore, cellular nucleic acids (mRNA or miRNA) have been harnessed to promote assemblies and reactions in live cells. The tolerance of PNA synthesis also lends itself to the encoding of small molecules that can be further assembled on the basis of their nucleic acid sequences. It is now well-established that hybridization-based assemblies displaying two or more ligands can interact synergistically with a target biomolecule. These assemblies have now been shown to be functional in vivo. Similarly, PNA-tagged macromolecules have been used to prepare bioactive assemblies and three-dimensional nanostructures. Several technologies based on DNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers or DNA-templated display of ligands have been shown to be compatible with reiterative cycles of selection\/amplification starting with large libraries of DNA templates, bringing the power of in vitro evolution to synthetic molecules and offering the possibility of exploring uncharted molecular diversity space with unprecedented scope and speed.","4231":"The aim of this work is to study the linear viscoelastic region limit of isotropic magnetorheological elastomers at different compositions and working conditions. Regarding the synthesis process, the matrix and the particle content are analysed. The analysed matrixes are a natural rubber, a silicone rubber and ELASTOSIL((R)) silicone, and three particle contents are synthesised. The influence of the characterisation variables on the linear viscoelastic limit, that is, frequency, external magnetic field and temperature, is also analysed. Strain sweep tests are used to determine the dynamic complex modulus. The loss factor and the storage modulus are analysed to define the linear viscoelastic limit of each isotropic magnetorheological elastomer sample in all the working conditions. The results show that the linear viscoelastic region of the magnetorheological elastomers is defined by the loss factor. Moreover, the volumetric particle content reduces and frequency increases the linear viscoelastic region of all the matrixes, whereas the external magnetic field and the temperature influences are matrix dependent.","4085":"Electrochemical oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) via nonprecious catalysts have potential for significant cost reduction in fuel cells. Dense, multi-layered poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) nanofibers dispersed with catalytically active carbon nitride (CNx) nanoparticles were synthesized using an electrospinning process. The size, morphology, elemental composition, and bond structure of the CNx\/PVA nanofibers were analysed using TEM, SEM, FTIR, XPS and Raman spectroscopic studies. Significant improvement in the electrocatalytic activity of the CNx nanoparticles dispersed in the nanofibers as compared to their native form was observed towards the ORR using voltammetry coupled with FTIR studies. The onset potential and peak current density observed for the CNx\/PVA nanofibers using cyclic voltammetry were comparable to those of a conventional Pt\/C (40 : 60% by weight) catalyst. The ORR mechanism was further analysed using a RRDE and in situ FTIR with linear sweep voltammetry studies. RRDE analysis confirmed that the ORR takes place primarily via a 4-electron pathway. The catalytic activity of the CNx\/PVA nanofibers for the ORR was stable over 5000 repetitions in the voltammetric studies coupled with FTIR.","1176":"Fluorescent poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV)\/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fibrous membrane was prepared via electrospinning of PPV precursor and PVA aqueous solution followed by thermal elimination. Further cross-linking produced the cross-linked membrane PPV\/CPVA. Both PPV\/PVA and PPV\/CPVA membranes were found to have similar morphology and photophysics. These membranes showed a great fluorescence quenching response to aromatic solvents and a much smaller response to other organic solvents. Water also effectively quenched the fluorescence of PPV\/PVA but not that of PPV\/CPVA. This was attributed to un-cross-linked PVA being able to dissolve in water and the cross-linking improving the resistance of the membrane toward water. The sensing behavior was found to have good reversibility. The contact angle study showed that addition of only about 1% of PPV into the matrix reduced the hydrophilicity of the membrane significantly, suggesting that the PPV chains would be located at the surface of the fibers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation further confirmed such surface enrichment of PPV in the binary polymer blends. The PPV chain on the surface facilitated the pi-pi interaction between the polymer backbones and the aromatic molecules, thus leading to good selectivity and fast response of the two fibrous membranes toward aromatic solvents.","7139":"Special hollow ZnFe2O4\/ZnO hybrid spheres were successfully designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal procedure. Carbon spheres were used as the core template, which were removed during the calcination process in an air-rich atmosphere, thus leading to interior voids and an outer shell structure due to the contraction and combustion of the carbon spheres. The hybrid ZnFe2O4\/ZnO hollow spheres not only possess a hollow structure, but also have a porous shell with a thickness of approximately 30 nm. Inspired by this special structure and design composition, a gas sensor based on the hybrid ZnFe2O4\/ZnO hollow spheres showed a high response and fast response\/recovery speed compared with nanoparticles. A short response time usually enables a gas sensor to accurately detect and real-time monitor a certain target gas. This study may give insight for the rational fabrication of high performance sensing materials.","6274":"Low-density graphene\/carbon composite aerogels were prepared by sol-gel polymerization, ambient pressure drying and carbonization in an inert gas atmosphere. The preparation conditions, including the initial pH, solid concentration of the precursor solution, and the GO loading content, were investigated in detail. The dispersed graphene nanosheets in the carbon aerogel (CA) matrix made significant contributions to the decreased densities (as low as 0.11 g cm(-3)) of the CAs. The resultant composite CAs exhibited high specific surface area (>400 m(2) g(-1)), high compression strength (19.9 MPa at a density of 0.404 g cm(-3)), and extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.028 W m(-1) K-1, equal to one fifth of the value of the pristine carbon aerogel.","491":"To widen the application of nanofibers web in the field of medical health materials, a new Ag\/amino-terminated hyperbranched polymer (HBP)\/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber web with excellent antimicrobial activity and filtration property was produced with Ag\/HBP dispersion solution and PAN nanofiber. Ag\/HBP dispersion solution was prepared with HBP as reducer and stabilizer, and Ag\/HBP\/PAN nanofiber was prepared by modifying electrospun PAN nanofiber with Ag\/HBP aqueous solution. The characterization results showed that spherical Ag nanoparticles were prepared and they had a narrow distribution in HBP aqueous solution. The results of Ag\/HBP\/PANnanofiber characterized with SEM and EDS showed that the content of silver nanoparticles on the surface of PAN nanofiber was on the increase when the treating temperature rose. The bacterial reduction rates of HBP-treated PAN nanofiber against S. aureus and E. coli were about 89%, while those of the Ag\/HBP\/PANnanofiber against S. aureus and E. coli were 99.9% and 99.96%, respectively, due to the cooperative effects from the amino groups in HBP and Ag nanoparticles. Moreover, the small pores and high porosity in Ag\/HBP\/PAN nanofiber web resulted in high filtration efficiency (99.9%) for removing smaller particles (0.1 mu m similar to 0.7 mu m), which was much higher than that of the gauze mask.","6902":"Huge reserves of uranium (U) in seawater have been of interest to scientists and energy companies since the 1950s. However, extracting trace concentrations (3.3 ppb) of U from seawater is economically unfeasible without new, high-performance adsorbents. Here, a mat-like nanofibrous composite adsorbent containing binary coordination groups (amidoxime (AO) and carboxyl (AC(-))) in a highly porous network of nanofibers is constructed via a parallel-blend electrospinning method. Its U uptake in artificial seawater is more than double those of adsorbents containing AO or AC(-) groups alone. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this synergistic effect is because the AC(-) group promotes both the U 5f\/6d orbital contribution to U-AO bonding and the dissociation of uranyl tricarbonate ions in seawater. In a continuous flow-through experiment with simulated seawater, the nanofibrous adsorbent achieves an adsorption capacity up to 2.86 mg U g(ads)(-1) in 30 d but without saturation, indicating a high efficiency for U extraction.","3881":"The development of 3D nanoarchitectures on flexible current collectors has emerged as an effective strategy for preparing advanced portable and wearable power sources. Herein, a flexible and efficient electrode is demonstrated based on electrospun carbon fibers (ECF) substrate with elaborately designed hierarchical porous V2O5 nanosheets (V2O5-ECF). The unique configuration of V2O5-ECF composite film fully enables utilization of the synergistic effects from both high electrochemical performance of V2O5 and excellent conductivity of ECF, endowing the films to be an excellent electrode for flexible and lightweight electrochemical capacitors (ECs). Benefiting from their intriguing structural features, V2O5-ECF and ECF films, directly used as electrodes for flexible asymmetric quasi-solid-state electrochemical capacitors, achieve superior flexibility and reliability, enhanced energy\/power density, and outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, the ability to power light-emitting diodes (LED) also indicates the feasibility for practical use. Therefore, it is believed that this novel design may find promising application in flexible devices in future.","2970":"Bioreactors have great potential in the successful development of tissue-engineered heart valve replacements, both at the research stage and in commercial platforms. Their ability to mimick the chemical and physiological conditions of the body has allowed researchers to study in vitro cellular responses, and this has helped in the fabrication of better and more efficient tissues in vivo. Use of different bioreactors, such as, rotating, dynamic flexure, cyclic stretch and pulsatile bioreactors, in tissue engineering of heart valves has been widely investigated. However, this research is still at its early stage, and many critical issues need to be resolved to make tissue engineered heart valves sufficiently reliable for clinical applications. In the following article, after a brief introduction to the structure and role of heart valves, the efforts of tissue engineers in designing heart valves using different bioreactors is described.

SF was coated with a layer of entangled silver nanowires (AgNWs) that were sputtered with a platinum layer. The SF-AgNWs composite films exhibited excellent performance with a conductivity of similar to 15.0 Omega sq(-1) and transmittance of similar to 80% in the visible light range. The films also retained conductivity even after being bent hundreds of times; this recovery was attributed to the structure of the embedded AgNWs in SF, and metallic contacts among the AgNWs induced by the ion sputtering. The SF-AgNWs composite films also showed promise in practical applications, including as a conduit to light emitting diodes (LEDs). These novel composite films could be used to fabricate wearable electronics and implantable devices.","1615":"Titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy) was synthesized by reactive magnetron sputtering in a mixed N-2\/O-2\/Ar gas at ambient temperature. TiOxNy thin films with various amounts of nitrogen contents were deposited by varying the N-2\/O-2 ratios in the background gas. The synthesized TiOxNy films with different compositions (TiO1.837N0.060, TiO1.890N0.068, TiO1.865N0.073, and TiO1.882N0.163) all displayed anatase phase, except TiO1.882N0.163. The impedances and grain sizes showed obvious variations with the nitrogen contents. A wide potential window from 3.0 V to 0.05 V, high-rate charge-discharge testing, and long cycle testing were applied to investigate the performances of synthesized TiOxNy and pure TiO2 as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. These TiOxNy anodes can be cycled under high rates of 125 mu A\/cm(2) (10 degrees C) because of the lower charge-transfer resistance compared with the TiO2 anode. At 10 degrees C the discharge capacity of the optimal TiOxNy composition is 1.5 times higher than that of pure TiO2. An unexpectedly large reversible capacity of similar to 300 mu Ah\/cm(2) mu m (similar to 800 mAh\/g) between 1.0 V and 0.05 V was recorded for the TiOxNy anodes. The TiOxNy anode was cycled (3.0 V to 0.05 V) at 10 degrees C over 300 times without capacity fading while delivering a capacity of similar to 150 mu Ah\/cm(2) mu m (similar to 400 mAh\/g).

However, for the actual applications, a Si electrode must possess superior electrochemical properties, and the fabrication must be cost-effective and industrially scalable. Here, we report a highly scalable and low-cost route of recovering high-purity Si micro-plates from photovoltaic industry waste obtained during diamond-wire slicing of solar grade Si ingots, and demonstrate their great potential as high-performance anode materials with ideal cost. To accommodate the severe volume effect of Si micro-plates, a firmly anchored alginate coating layer is formed on the Si surface on the basis of the strong interactions between the oxidized Si and alginate carboxylic groups, which helps to construct a robust conductive network around Si micro-plates and allows the electrode architecture to be perfectly maintained even though the Si micro-plates are pulverized into nanoparticles. The recycled Si anode delivers high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and extraordinary cyclability. This new technology not only provides an abundant and low-cost Si source for LIB applications, but also effectively resolves the waste disposal issue of the photovoltaic industry, which may therefore bring about enormous environmental and economic benefits.","2955":"With the aim of removing binary metal ions from aqueous solutions, the adsorption characteristics of sawdust modified with citric acid are investigated using adsorption kinetics and isotherms in both an experiment and a numerical simulation. The adsorption of metal ions is characterized by the competitive adsorption in binary metal ion systems that results from the stability constants between metal ions and citrate in the modified sawdust. These findings suggest that competitive adsorption and the affinities of the metal ion adsorbents play important roles in the removal of metal ions and that the numerical simulation can predict the adsorption characteristics of the modified sawdust.","7163":"Thermochromic materials are the most cost effective smart window materials and the organic hydrogel material has large solar modulating ability (Delta T-sol) and the luminous transmittance (T-lum) compared with inorganic VO2 based materials. Here we report a green and new organic thermochromic material based on hydroxypropylcellulose. With increasing addition of NaCl from 0.5% (wt%) to 5% (wt%), the LCST (lower critical solution temperature) could reduce from 42 degrees C to 30 degrees C. The morphology change of freeze dried samples below and above LCST proves that the phase change of this hydroxypropylcellulose based hydrogel is due to the solubility change of the polymer in water. The fine-tuned recipe can give an outstanding solar modulating ability (Delta T-sol) of 25.7% and high averaged T-lum of 67.4% with LCST of 38 degrees C.","1662":"We report the incorporation of sulfur (S)-containing groups into the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) architectures for high performance supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. The S-incorporated RGO aerogel (SRGA) have three-dimensional (3D) intemetworked morphology, thereby improving the accessibility to storage sites and ion diffusion. The morphology and chemical structure of the SRGA are comprehensively investigated by spectroscopic methods. The SC electrodes show excellent electrochemical properties such as high specific capacitance of 445.6 F g(-1) at scan rate of 5 mV s(-1), good rate capability of 78.2% and cyclic stability of 73.4% over 1500 cycles due to the existence of S-containing groups and 3D macroscopic structure. As a consequence of the pseudocapacitive feature of S-containing groups, these capacitance enhancements become more pronounced in an aqueous electrolyte despite the enlargement of operating window in organic and ionic liquid electrolytes for high energy applications.

Mg2Si needs to be doped in order to increase its efficiency, making this material competitive among materials operating in the intermediate temperature range. In this work, a synthesis procedure based on melting of the raw elements in easily available and cheap Al2O3 crucibles was developed to obtain polycrystalline Sb doped Mg2Si materials in a wide range of compositions. Powders from the crushed lumps were consolidated via spark plasma sintering and then thermally annealed to obtain dense pellets of Sb:Mg2Si with Sb = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 at%. The effects of Sb doping and of the synthesis and sintering technique on composition, morphology and stability of n-type Mg2Si are discussed. Transport properties (Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, charge carrier density) were evaluated in order to elucidate the composition-property relationship within this material system and find the optimal doping amount to optimize its thermoelectric properties.","852":"Thermal transport in suspended graphene samples has been measured in prior works and this work with the use of a suspended electro-thermal micro-bridge method. These measurement results are analyzed here to evaluate and eliminate the errors caused by the extrinsic thermal contact resistance. It is noted that the room-temperature thermal resistance measured in a recent work increases linearly with the suspended length of the single-layer graphene samples synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and that such a feature does not reveal the failure of Fourier's law despite the increase in the reported apparent thermal conductivity with length. The re-analyzed apparent thermal conductivity of a single-layer CVD graphene sample reaches about 1680 +\/- 180 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, which is close to the highest value reported for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. In comparison, the apparent thermal conductivity values measured for two suspended exfoliated bi-layer graphene samples are about 880 +\/- 60 and 730 +\/- 60 Wm(-1) K-1 at room temperature, and approach that of the natural graphite source above room temperature. However, the low-temperature thermal conductivities of these suspended graphene samples are still considerably lower than the graphite values, with the peak thermal conductivities shifted to much higher temperatures. Analysis of the thermal conductivity data reveals that the low temperature behavior is dominated by phonon scattering by polymer residue instead of by the lateral boundary. (C) 2015 Author(s).

Our work has shown improved microcapsules when incorporating the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), in terms of morphology and cell viability although cell survival remained low. Thus, the study aimed at incorporating the polyelectrolytes polyallylamine (PAA) and poly-l-ornithine (PLO), with the polymer sodium alginate (SA) and the hydrogel ultrasonic gel (USG) with UDCA and examined cell viability and functionality post microencapsulation. Microcapsules without (control) and with UDCA (test) were produced using 1% PLO, 2.5% PAA, 1.8% SA and 4.5% USG. Pancreatic beta-cells were microencapsulated and the microcapsules' morphology, surface components, cellular and bile acid distribution, osmotic and mechanical stability as well as biocompatibilities, insulin production, bioenergetics and the inflammatory response were tested. Incorporation of UDCA at 4% into a PLO-PAA-SA formulation system increased cell survival (p < 0.01), insulin production (p < 0.01), reduced the inflammatory profile (TNF-alpha, IFN-I', IL-6 and IL-1 beta; p < 0.01) and improved the microcapsule physical and mechanical strength (p < 0.01). beta-cell microencapsulation using 1% PLO, 2.5% PAA, 1.8% SA, 4.5% USG and the bile acid UDCA (4%) has good potential in cell transplantation and diabetes treatment.","4715":"Effective industrial waste management is one of the challenges facing modern society. One possible solution, the inclusion of different proportions of waste of varying nature in concrete, calls for a thorough study of the durability of the resulting materials. Direct and indirect durability indices can be used to ensure that such concrete is able to withstand the actions to which it will be exposed throughout its service life to design safety, functionality and aesthetics and with no unexpected maintenance costs. In the present study, 20% and 25% of the natural coarse aggregate in concrete was replaced with recycled aggregate from the sanitary ware industry to explore the effect on chloride penetration and electrical resistivity, as well as the relationship among the durability indicators that predict concrete performance during its service life. The findings showed that chloride penetration was slightly deeper in recycled concretes, while no alterations were observed in the relationship among durability indicators. Electrical resistivity, in turn, was observed to rise with the use of recycled aggregate due to the intrinsic characteristics of this material. The new concretes proved to be as durable as the conventional material, performing satisfactorily throughout their service life. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The SFO and F nanocomposites are formed after the selective reduction of the oxide precursor at 375 degrees C for 1 h. The magnetic property difference of these SFCNWs measured at 297 K and 77 K largely arises from the competition of magnetic exchange-coupling interaction and thermal fluctuation on dipolar interactions. With the mass ratios (SFO\/F) increase, the minimum reflection loss (RL) with 3.0 mm thickness reaches the optimized value of -51.1 dB at 10.4 GHz for the mass ratio (SFO:F) of 7:3. While the microwave absorption bandwidth exceeding -20 dB with a thickness of 4.0 mm covers the whole G-band, X-band and 20% Ku-band.

However, there is currently a strong lack of an efficient tool for the direct manufacture of electronics as desired. Meanwhile, although printed electronics has aroused much attention in making printed circuit board, radio frequency identification card, sensor and so on, few existing approaches can fulfill the above needs. Among various technologies, liquid metal spraying method owns rather unique merits in printing electronically conductive patterns on nearly all kinds of substrates, either hard or soft, rough or smooth. For this reason, we are dedicated here to extend such method into a generalized strategy of printing electronics for the direct construction of smart home appliances which would generate profound influence on future daily lives. Through adopting the room temperature liquid metal GaIn24.5 as the electronic ink and with various designed masks, a group of typical conductive patterns were directly printed on the surfaces of organic glass, marble windowsill, paper, wood plank of cabinet, building wall and so on, which consist of the most popular materials that could serve as circuit substrates in a home. It was shown that this energy-saving printing method brings about big convenience for equipping future smart home residents. Several new conceptual homemade printed patterns or circuits in providing services such as decoration and entertainment were illustrated. Further, the basic electronic structures of the smart home and the generalized concept of adopting any substrate surface as printed circuit board were explained. The liquid metal spray printing suggests a powerful tool for making consumer electronics and constructing future smart home. It also raised important scientific and technical issues worth of pursuing in the coming time. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

In this work, a novel kind of composite nanofibers membrane (thermal plastic elastomer ester (TPEE) A100H) was first proposed by a simple method, based on a hybrid strategy composed of electrospinning and hydrothermal method. The obtained nanofibrous membrane was turned out to be a petaloid structure, which can enlarge the specific surface area of electrospun fibers. Furthermore, the Cr (VI) removal experiments suggested that the obtained nanofibrous membrane showed a high and fast efficiency, a stable recyclable property for the Cr (VI) removal.

In CCNFs with G\/Si, Si NPs are distributed and preserved inside the CNF surface because the graphene wrapping the Si NPs help prevent agglomeration and ensure a good dispersion of Si NPs inside the CNF matrix. 20-GSP prepared from a weight ratio of 20 wt% of G\/Si to polyacrylonitrile exhibits stable capacity retention and a reversible capacity of above 600 mAh g(-1) up to 100 cycles. The high cycling performance and superior reversible capacity of the 20-GSP anode can be attributed to the one-dimensional nanofibrous structure with non-agglomerated Si NPs in the CNF matrix, which promotes charge transfer, maintains a stable electrical contact, and buffers the Si volume expansion.

AC3 deficiency leads to defects in olfaction. However, it is still unknown whether AC3 deficiency affects gene expression or olfactory signal transduction pathways within the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). In this study, gene microarrays were used to screen differentially expressed genes in MOE from AC3 knockout (AC3(-\/-)) and wild-type (AC3(+\/+)) mice. The differentially expressed genes identified were subjected to bioinformatic analysis and verified by qRT-PCR. Gene expression in the MOE from AC3(-\/-) mice was significantly altered, compared to AC3(+\/+) mice. Of the 41266 gene probes, 3379 had greater than 2-fold fold change in expression levels between AC3(-\/-) and AC3(+\/+) mice, accounting for 8% of the total gene probes. Of these genes, 1391 were up regulated, and 1988 were down regulated, including 425 olfactory receptor genes, 99 genes that are specifically expressed in the immature olfactory neurons, 305 genes that are specifically expressed in the mature olfactory neurons, and 155 genes that are involved in epigenetic regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR verification of the differentially expressed epigenetic regulation related genes, olfactory receptors, ion transporter related genes, neuron development and differentiation related genes, lipid metabolism and membrane protein transport etc. related genes showed that P75NTR, Hinfp, Gadd45b, and Tet3 were significantly up-regulated, while Olfr370, Olfr1414, Olfr1208, Golf, Faim2, Tsg101, Mapk10, Actl6b, H2BE, ATF5, Kirrrel2, OMP, Drd2etc. were significantly down-regulated.

In the first step, a PR macroinitiator was synthesized by end-capping of an adamantane stopper (AD stopper). In second step, the PR copolymer was prepared via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) with a PR macroinitiator. Furthermore, it was found the cyclodextrin (CD) content in the PR macroinitiator was controllable in the first step, whereas the degree of polymerization (DP) of butylmethacrylate (BMA) also appeared tunable in the second step. Moreover, the PR copolymer was processed into a self-standing film via solution casting and a nonwoven mat with good morphology via electrospinning. The strain-stress test showed the film had a higher tensile strength than universal plastics, and pure PBMA and dynamic mechanical analyzer results inferred that the movement of the PR block may be also present in the PR copolymer and have some influence on the copolymer's mechanical properties. In conclusion, the controllability of CD content and polymer chain length provide enough room to modify its molecular structure so as to design and synthesize different PR copolymers with various properties and broaden their application field from solution and hydrogels to the solid state.","6053":"Copper oxide (CuO) nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized in the form of dense mesh via electrospinning technique and evaluated as infrared (IR) photodetectors. When illuminated with an IR (808 nm) laser diode with a power density of 10-40 mW\/cm(2), significant photocurrent with a response time as low as 1-2 ms was observed. Such efficient photodetection behavior of electrospun CuO NFs was attributed to their unique morphology defined by tiny crystalline domains attached together in a linear 1D fashion offering very high surface-to-volume ratio and efficient electron transport.

High elasticity has established PU as a functional material with various applications such as artificial tendons, vascular grafts, protective clothing, wound dressing and 2D and 3D scaffolds. The main goal of this research is the fabrication and characterization of pristine and hollow yam from polyurethane nanofibers via the electrospinning process. In this work, PU nanofibrous yarn is successfully produced via the electrospinning process. The effect of the twist level on the mechanical properties is assessed by altering the twist level. Hollow yarn was produced by feeding PVA filaments as the core and dissolving them in warm water. High tenacity and superior elasticity were found to be unique properties of PU electrospun yarn. Increasing the twist level led to decreased tenacity of PU nanofibrous yarns. The surface morphology and diameter of the nanofibers and fractured yarns were studied by SEM and are reported.

The interaction of GO and PEI was investigated by FT-IR and XPS analysis and after that further characterization was conducted using SEM, EDX, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and BET surface area measurement. The prepared GOPEI aerogel was utilized for the treatment of As(V) and As(III) contaminated water. The maximum uptake capacity, 4.80 +\/- 0.27 mg g(-1) for As(V) and 4.26 +\/- 0.24 mg g(-1) for As(III), was obtained at an initial As(V)\/ As(III) concentration of 3 mg L-1, GOPEI dose 0.6 g L-1, and ambient temperature (30 degrees C). The adsorption process was found to be pH sensitive where the optimum pH was 4 for As(V) and 7 for As(III) whereas at pH 6 significant uptake capacity was observed for both As(V) and As(III), which is close to the pH of drinking water. Therefore, GOPEI can be used for the adsorption of As(V) as well as As(III) at a common pH and ambient temperature without much changing the pH of drinking water. In order to use the GOPEI aerogel as an adsorbent in a continuous column for the treatment of arsenic contaminated water, the practicability was tested by conducting detailed kinetics, isotherm and thermodynamics studies. The adsorption, which occurs on a monolayer on the heterogeneous surface of the GOPEI aerogel, was found to be thermodynamically feasible and follows pseudo-second-order kinetics.","2287":"Montmorillonite was functionalized by (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxy silane (GPTMS).

Compared with the pure CS and CS\/PWA-MMT membrane, these CS\/PWA-MMT\/Silane hybrid membranes show apparently high proton conductivity and the lower methanol permeability, which could be assigned to the better interfacial morphology and compatibility between chitosan matrix and GPTMS-modified montmorillonite. In all the prepared CS\/PWA-MMT\/Silane hybrid membranes, the CS membrane filled by 10% GPTMS-modified montmorillonite particles exhibits the highest proton conductivity and the lowest methanol permeability, which is 19.15 x 10(-3) S.cm(-1) at 80 degrees C and 4.33 x 10(-8) cm(2).s(-1), respectively.

The collagen sponge was composed of at least two a-peptides, and its denaturation temperature was 44.99 degrees C. It did not change the number of spleen-derived lymphocytes in BALB\/c mice, the ratio of CD4(+)\/CD8(+) lymphocytes, and the level of IgG or IgM in Sprague-Dawley rat. The contact angle, tensile strength, and weight loss temperature of collagen nanofibers were 21.2 degrees, 6.72 +\/- 0.44 MPa, and 300 degrees C, respectively. The nanofibers could promote the viabilities of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), inducing epidermal differentiation through the gene expression of involucrin, filaggrin, and type I transglutaminase of HaCaTs, and they could also accelerate migration of HaCaTs with the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Besides, the nanofibers could upregulate the protien level of Col-I in HDFs both via a direct effect and TGF-beta 1 secreted from HaCaTs, thus facilitating the formation of collagen fibers. Furthermore, the collagen nanofibers stimulated the skin regeneration rapidly and effectively in vivo. These biological effects could be explained as the contributions from the biomimic extracellular cell matrix structure, hydrophilicity, and the multiple amino acids of the collagen nanofibers.","6225":"The biomimetic sol-gel synthesis of silicon-chitosan-containing glycerohydrogels was carried out using silicon tetraglycerolate as a precursor.

However, conventional studies focused on keratinases from bacterial and fungal strains, especially those of the Bacillus genus, keratinase resources from actinomycetes are far from being fully explored. In this study, a novel keratinase-producing strain was isolated with wool as the sole carbon and nitrogen source and identified as Streptomyces aureofaciens K13. The keratinase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity with a molecular mass of 46 kDa. The purified enzyme exhibited optimum activity at 75 degrees C and pH of 12.0. It remained extremely stable at alkaline pH values between 6 and 12 and at a high reaction temperature of 65 degrees C. The keratinase displayed significant activity toward casein, keratin, BSA and wool. It could be activated in the presence of K+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Li+, and Sr2+. The keratinase was completely inhibited by PMSF and moderately inhibited by EDTA, indicating that this keratinase is a metallo-serine keratinase. This enzyme could remain stable and even be promoted in the presence of surfactants, including SDS, Tween, and Triton; especially, 1% of Tween 80 and Triton X-100 could substantially enhance the activity by 46% and 38%, respectively. These results indicated certain advantages over conventional keratinases. The keratinase can completely remove blood stains when combined with detergents. The improvement effect of S. aureofaciens K13 keratinase by various surfactants and the favourable washing performance might indicate its significant application potential in the detergent industry. There are rare reports on keratinase production from S. aureofaciens.","1807":"Sodium alginate and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were combined to produce magnetic nanocomposite beads that were used for the removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions at a temperature of 25 degrees C and a stirring rate of 150 rpm. The different parameters affecting the adsorption capacity of the synthesized material such as contact time (30-270 min), pH (3-7), adsorbent dosage (5-10 g per 50 mL of wet beads), and initial Cu(II) concentration (50-450 mg\/L) were investigated. Of all of the variables, the solution pH has the most significant effect on the adsorption capacity, particularly in the range of 4-6. Response surface methodology was used for modeling and optimizing the uptake process. While the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model, the adsorption isotherms were better fitted by the Langmuir equation. The results revealed that the maximum removal percentage was 92.6% from the initial Cu(II) concentration (150 mg\/L) at pH 6, adsorbent dose (8.0 g\/50 mL), and contact time (210 min). Therefore, the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite product could act as a highly effective nanoadsorbent in Cu(II) removal from the aqueous solutions.","5067":"An effective exchange method is described whereby liposomal drug carriers of hydrophobic guest biomolecules are used to incorporate the guests into lipid membranes.

Using ammonium fluoride in the precursor solution allowed for tunability of the aerogel morphology while no change in the conductivity was measured. In particular, aerogel shrinkage was decreased dramatically by the addition of the fluoride precursor. Unfluorinated aerogels showed severe shrinkage of 43% volume change upon supercritical drying compared to the original alcogel volume. Fluorinated samples exhibited a much less pronounced shrinkage at 7%. Multiple characterization methods converged to reveal the mechanism by which fluoride enables the morphological tunability. These findings enable the casting of SnO2 aerogels as thin films (which in the absence of fluoride these crack and delaminate due to shrinkage), opening potential uses in many optoelectronic devices including solar cells.","1451":"The valorization of Scenedesmus sp. microalgae byproducts was investigated, as a potential route for the production of road binders from renewable sources.

Although the chemical composition of the obtained materials completely differs from that of petroleum-based bitumen, similar viscoelastic properties were observed in some cases, depending on the hydrothermal liquefaction experimental conditions. A rheological simple material could thus be obtained, which compared well with a bitumen reference.","6652":"Macrophages are important therapeutic targets for various disorders, including infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer.

Using this formulation, the model drug tylophorine malate (NK007) was tightly incorporated inside beta-glucan particle shells by the formation of colloidal particles with chitosan, tripolyphosphate, and alginate via electrostatic interactions. This formulation specifically delivered NK007 to macrophages in vivo after oral gavage and effectively cured colitis in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine colitis model, highlighting the utility of beta-glucan particles as an oral anti-inflammation drug delivery system by targeting macrophages. In this work, NK007 was selected as the model drug. However, this novel oral carrier system has the potential to be applied as a platform for the treatment of many other diseases for which macrophages are the therapeutic targets.

Self-assembly has also become an important theme in organic materials research. Within our research program on -conjugated organophosphorus materials, we have recently aimed to combine the unique optoelectronic properties of organophosphorus building blocks with self-assembly features. Our novel organophosphorus-based chromophore mesogens self-assemble into complex structures, such as liquid crystals and organogels. More importantly, intriguing optoelectronic properties not present in the original building blocks are also produced as a result. These results have opened up a rich chemistry toward smart functional materials that is currently being further exploited in our group.","3153":"Resistive type humidity sensors made from the composite films of HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose) and MWCNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) were developed. Three kinds of HEC\/MWCNT composite films were fabricated, which contained 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 wt-% MWCNTs. Rapid response capability and high sensitivities of the composite sensors were confirmed. For the convenience of sensors calibration, the non-linear resistance change ratios can be linearised by performing natural logarithm operation on them. A new sensitivity factor was defined based on this linear relationship between the logarithm of the resistance change ratio and relative humidity. For comparison, a reference humidity sensor was also made from the composite film of HEC filled by 50.0 wt-% CBs (carbon blacks). Compared with the HEC\/MWCNT sensors, the HEC\/CB sensor was of much higher sensitivity, but lower repeatability and stability under cyclic humidity changes. Possible sensing mechanisms were discussed in detail.","1055":"Chitosan-based CNT composite fibers have received much attention due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, further development and practical application of the fibers has been blocked due to their relatively low mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. In order to overcome these disadvantages and to extend the practical applicability of the composite fibers based on chitosan, a novel composite fiber based chitosan\/MWNT composite and cross-linked polyurethane (PU) with 4,4'-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) were newly developed herein using a wet-spinning technique. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method was highly effective, allowing practical formation of the structures with enhancement of the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity by cross-linked PU as well as optimized MWNTs in the chitosan\/MWNT composites fibers. Furthermore, the fabricated composite fibers with good mechanical strength (88.2 MPa) and excellent electrical conductivity (7.3 S cm(-1)) can be fluidly spun on any substrate.","535":"Free-standing 2D Au nanosphere array\/hydrogel composite sensing films were prepared by attaching a 2D Au nanosphere array onto a polyacrylic acid (PAAc) hydrogel film, which could be used as visualized sensors. These 2D Au nanosphere array\/hydrogel composite films displayed visually diffraction color and much stronger diffraction intensity due to their periodic structures and large scattering cross-section of the Au nanospheres. Their diffraction intensity was increased by more than one order of magnitude (88 times) compared to that of 2D PS sphere array\/hydrogel composite films to external stimuli, which is useful for visual observation by the naked eye and further optical characterization. Such 2D Au nanosphere array\/hydrogel composite films exhibit ultrahigh diffraction intensity for them to be used for the visual determination of an analyte. The presented strategy could be extended to develop different visualized sensors based on various functional hydrogel films.","3011":"A successful method for fabrication of electrospun hydroxyapatite (HAp) coated cellulose nanofiber scaffold (HAp\/CMC) for tissue engineering is reported. The cellulose acetate nanofibers (CANFs) were deacetylated to produce cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) which were subsequently converted to sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (Na-CMC). The Na-CMC nanofibers mat was then coated with HAp for bone regeneration applications. The FTIR results confirmed conversion of CANFs to CNFs and CNFs to Na-CMC. HAp nanocrystal growth was observed in SEM images, with crystal becoming minute and numerous upon increasing HCO3- in the simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The proliferation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells on HAp-coated CMC nanofiber mat was observed to increase with seeding time. The results confirm suitability of the HAp\/CMC nanofiber mat for bone regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nanoparticles of C-60 embedded in PANI nanofibres, as well as a coating of larger C-60 clusters with PANI, are confirmed by SEM and TEM. An interaction between the C-60 and PANI is indicated by both UV-vis and FTIR studies. The remarkable yield of 45% is obtained after only 10 min in the presence of 10% of C-60. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The starting point of the processes is to produce raw silicon materials from a natural resource via mostly carbothermic reduction. However, this process is very complicated and SiO and SiC form as by-products. Further improvement of the carbothermic reduction process requires an understanding in real time of the reactions occurring and the weight change during heating. In particular, the behavior of the SiO by-product plays a major role in the production of silicon because the loss of Si is caused by the escape of SiO gas. In this study, we developed an in-situ weight measuring system for our induction heating furnace, and successfully suppressed much of the error in weight by improving the crucible configuration. The real-time monitoring of the crucible weight loss during the reaction may assist in understanding of the carbothermic reduction process in a more detailed fashion.","5055":"Psoriasis is a common skin disease accompanied by chronic inflammation. In previous studies, erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (ERDR1) was shown to have a negative correlation with proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. However, the role of ERDR1 in the inflammatory skin disease psoriasis has not been evaluated. In this study, to investigate the role of ERDR1 in psoriasis, recombinant ERDR1 was injected intraperitoneally into a psoriasis mouse model. Recombinant ERDR1 (rERDR1) significantly alleviated the symptoms of psoriasis-like skin inflammation and reduced the mRNA of various psoriasis-related markers, including keratin 14, S100A8, and Th17-related cytokines IL-17 and IL-22, suggesting that rERDR1 exerts therapeutic effects on psoriasis via the regulation of Th17 functions. Additionally, the expression of CCL20, a well-known Th17 attracting chemokine, was determined. CCL20 expression significantly decreased in the rERDR1-injected group compared with the vehicle (PBS)-injected group. CCR6 expression in the psoriatic lesional skin was also decreased by rERDR1 administration, implying the inhibition of CCR6-expressing Th17 cell chemotaxis via the downregulation of CCL20. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that ERDR1 may be a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis.","5148":"Despite success in probing chemical reactions and dynamics of macromolecules on submillisecond time and nanometer length scales, a major impasse faced by nanopore technology is the need to cheaply and controllably modulate macromolecule capture and trafficking across the nanopore. We demonstrate herein that tunable charge separation engineered at the both ends of a macromolecule very efficiently modulates the dynamics of macromolecules capture and traffic through a nanometer-size pore. In the proof-of-principle approach, we employed a 36 amino acids long peptide containing at the N- and C-termini uniform patches of glutamic acids and arginines, flanking a central segment of asparagines, and we studied its capture by the alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) and the mean residence time inside the pore in the presence of a pH gradient across the protein. We propose a solution to effectively control the dynamics of peptide interaction with the nanopore, with both association and dissociation reaction rates of peptide-alpha-HL interactions spanning orders of magnitude depending upon solution acidity on the peptide addition side and the transmembrane electric potential, while preserving the amplitude of the blockade current signature.","4938":"Increasing use of the latest electronic gadgets in modern society causes rapid growth in electromagnetic pollution, which leads to detrimental effects on the function of highly sensitive precision electronic equipment as well as on human life. Mitigating this effect requires efficient electromagnetic radiation shielding materials, which should be lightweight, corrosion resistant and cost-effective. In this review article, we have presented lightweight polymer composite foams filled with carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes and graphene as efficient electromagnetic radiation shielding materials. It is seen that the low loading of multiwalled carbon nanotubes with uniform dispersion in polymer, uniform cell size of pore and controlled dielectric constant results in the attenuation of electromagnetic radiation by absorption phenomena. Flexible graphene-polymer composite foam derived using the chemical vapor deposition technique demonstrates a specific shielding effectiveness of similar to 333 dB cm(3) g(-1), which is the highest value among those reported in literature. The SE is mostly dominated by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation, which is due to the multiple reflection of radiation inside the cells of the composite foam. Moreover, different carbon nanomaterial, such as carbon nanofibers and few layer graphene-filled polymer composite foams, with varying content of conducting filler are reported in this review. Their use in different applications, their future prospective and the challenges ahead are discussed in this review.","7027":"Graphene aerogels are highly porous materials with many energy and environmental applications; tailoring the structure and composition of pore walls within the aerogel is the key to those applications. Here, by freeze casting the graphene oxide sheets, we directly fabricated freestanding porous graphene beads containing radially oriented through channels from the sphere center to its surface. Furthermore, we introduced pseudopolymer to make reinforced, functional composite beads with a unique pore morphology. We showed that polymer layers can be coated smoothly on both sides of the pore walls, as well as on the junctions between adjacent pores, resulting in uniform polymer-graphene-polymer sandwiched structures (skeletons) throughout the bead. These composite beads significantly improved the electrochemical properties, with specific capacitances up to 669 Fig and good cyclic stability. Our results indicate that controlled fabrication of homogeneous hierarchical structures is a potential route toward high performance composite electrodes for various energy applications.","4043":"The life cycle of a solar park made using organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology is assessed here. The modules have been fabricated in a pilot scale plant and they have been installed together with other components to evaluate the balance of system, in a solar park located in Denmark. Three possible waste management practices have been contemplated for the end of life of the solar park: recycling, incineration or the average local mix. The assessment of the environmental impacts of such a system reveals that silver used in the electrodes is overall the largest source of impacts, such as chemical pollution and metal depletion. The establishment of resource recovery systems for the end-of-life management of the OPV modules is therefore crucial to reduce overall environmental impacts. Liability on the manufacturers or on the operators should be implemented. The electricity produced from OPV solar parks yields similar footprints to other traditional energy technologies; e.g. coal and natural gas. However, when the efficiency of the OPV modules is increased from 1% to 5% they are comparable to other mature PV technologies already on the market. The effects of outsourcing or exporting the production of the OPV modules from Denmark to China have additionally been studied to determine the most advantageous configuration. The stakeholders should aim at anchoring the manufacturing of solar parks in countries with stringent emission standards and\/or high technology efficiencies, e.g. Denmark, and at deploying them in countries with high solar radiation to maximise the environmental benefits of the PV technology.","2966":"Controlling self-organization and morphology of chemical architectures is an essential challenge in the search for higher energy-conversion efficiencies in a variety of optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a highly ordered donor\/acceptor functional material, which has been obtained using the principle of ionic self-assembly. Initially, an electron donor pi-extended tetrathiafulvalene and an electron-acceptor perylene-bisimide were self-organized separately obtaining n- and p-nanofibers at the same scale. These complementary n- and p-nanofibers are endowed with ionic groups with opposite charges on their surfaces. The synergic interactions establish periodic alignments between both nanofibers resulting in a material with alternately segregated donor\/acceptor nanodomains. Photoconductivity measurements show values for these n\/p-co-assembled materials up to 0.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), confirming the effectiveness in the design of these heterojunction structures. This easy methodology offers great possibilities to achieve highly ordered n\/p-materials for potential applications in different areas such as optoelectonics and photovoltaics.","3989":"We designed and synthesized a simple fluorescent self-assembled molecular gel from a renewable resource and characterized it well using various techniques. The self-assembly mechanism was studied relative to the molecular structure. We also demonstrate that Fe3O4 nanoparticles were encapsulated in situ into the organogel by a simple process, which generated a magnetic gel with remarkable self-healing features. More importantly, stimuli responsive self-healing properties of the magnetic gel have been characterized by visual inspection, morphological and rheological analyses.","1175":"For the measurement of events of dopamine (DA) release as well as the coordinating neurotransmission in the nerve system, a neural microelectrode array (nMEA) electrodeposited directionally with polypyrrole graphene (PG) nanocomposites was fabricated. The deposited graphene significantly increased the surface area of working electrode, which led to the nMEA (with diameter of 20 mu m) with excellent selectivity and sensitivity to DA. Furthermore, PG film modification exhibited low detection limit (4 nM, S\/N = 3.21), high sensitivity, and good linearity in the presence of ascorbic acid (e.g., 13933.12 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the range of 0.8-10 mu M). In particular, the nMEA combined with the patch-clamp system was used to detect quantized DA release from pheochromocytoma cells under 100 mM K+ stimulation. The nMEA that integrates 60 microelectrodes is novel for detecting a large number of samples simultaneously, which has potential for neural communication research.","3653":"Layered MoS2 has attracted much attention as a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries. The intrinsically poor electrical\/ionic conductivity, volume expansion and pulverization, stress accumulation and unstable solid-electrolyte interface formation within MoS2 electrodes during the lithiation-delithiation process significantly result in their fast capacity fading, poor rate capability and cycle life. To address these critical issues, a novel nanobowl structure for MoS2 with a carbon coating (MoS2@C-400, 500, 600) is successfully fabricated by a facile solvothermal method, followed by a post-annealing process. The fabricated MoS2@C-600 and MoS2@C-500 exhibited high reversible capacities of 1164.4 and 1076.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, and maintained high capacity retention of 72.1% and 78.4% over 150 cycles, respectively. Such remarkable lithium storage properties are attributed to the unique nanobowl structure, which provides a large accessible surface area and high pore volume, and flexible carbon film coating, allowing for easy diffusion of electrolyte, alleviation of volume expansion, formation of stable solid electrolyte interfaces and fast diffusion of lithium ions.","1893":"Bamboo-like WO3 nanorods were anchored on three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (r-WO3\/3DNGF) by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis plus heating processes. There is a strong dependence of the obtained r-WO3\/3DNGF nanostructures on the content of 3DNGF. The composite with 20 wt% 3DNGF content shows the most favorable structure where bamboo-like WO3 nanorods lie flat on the surface of fungus-like 3DNGF, and exhibits a high discharge capacity of 828 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 80 mA g(-1) with the largest capacity retention of 73.9% for WO3 and excellent rate capacities of 719, 665, 573, 453 and 313 mAh g(-1) at 80, 160, 400, 800 and 1600 mA g(-1), respectively. The electrochemical performance is better than most of reported WO3-based carbonaceous composites, which can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the following actions: i) WO3 nanorods effectively shorten the diffusion path of Li+; ii) mechanically strong 3DNGF alleviates the huge volume change of WO3 upon Li+ intercalation\/extraction; and iii) nitrogen-doping in 3D graphene frameworks improves electronic conductivity and provides large numbers of lithium ion diffusion channels.

The color prediction relying on the single Gaussian-like band once again proved the usefulness of the PBE0 density functional due to the observed smallest color difference between computed and experimentally derived values. It was found that the alkali metal hydroxide molecules can bind to the two oxygen atoms of both hydroxyl groups of alizarin or to one of these atoms and the oxygen atom from the keto group in a complex with three methanol molecules. This means that two electronic transitions need to be taken into account when considering the spectra of the studied complexes. The resulting bond lengths and angles are correlated with the properties of the alkali metal atoms. The molar mass, the atomic radius, and the Pauling electronegativity of studied metals are quite accurate predictors of the geometric properties of hydroxide complexes with alizarin in methanol solution.","3616":"A novel ternary system composed of graphene, nickel and nickel oxide (RGO\/Ni\/NiO) has been constructed as a positive electrode for the first time via a facile route. The RGO\/Ni\/NiO composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, and could achieve a high specific capacitance of 1410 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 1020 F g(-1) at a high current density of 15 A g(-1). Meanwhile, porous carbon (PC) as a negative electrode has been synthesized by using activated carbon (AC) with further KOH activation. With the above two kinds of electrode materials, an advanced asymmetric supercapacitor of RGO\/Ni\/NiO\/\/PC is assembled and studied. The optimized asymmetric supercapacitor displays a superb performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 183.8 F g(-1) and high energy density of 65.3 W h kg(-1). Even at a high power density of 8000 W kg(-1), it can maintain 42.2 W h kg(-1), indicating remarkable rate performance. Additionally, the RGO\/Ni\/NiO\/\/PC asymmetric supercapacitor retains a high specific capacitance of 120 F g(-1) without capacitance loss after 3000 cycles at 8 A g(-1), demonstrating its long cycle life. This work provides new insight into the design of RGO\/Ni\/NiO as a positive electrode to fabricate high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. The obtained RGO\/Ni\/NiO\/\/PC shows superior electrochemical performance, suggesting a promising application in energy-storage devices.","473":"Cell-penetrating peptides have widespread applications in biomedicine because of their capability to translocate across cell membranes alone or with cargos. Although endocytosis and direct penetration pathways have been reported, the translocation mechanism remains incompletely understood. In this study, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as the model membrane to investigate experimentally and numerically the interaction mechanism between polyarginine peptides and the lipid bilayer. Experimental results show that the introduction of negatively charged lipids into the GUV membrane improves the direct penetration of peptides, and molecular dynamics simulation results show that R8 peptides induce the formation of a hydrophilic hole on the membrane and penetrate through the hole with the cooperation effect. The R8-GUV interaction depends not only on electrostatic interaction but also on other interactions; specifically, the peptide cooperation effect and hydrophilic interaction also participate in peptide penetration. Our results provide extensive insight into the peptide penetration mechanism and suggestions for drug and gene delivery.","3908":"A simple process is reported of the large-scale synthesis of microspherical mixed phase alpha-and beta-Ni (OH)(2) nanofibers produced by precipitation from aqueous NiCl2-NH4OH. These microspheres, with diameters of 20-50 mu m, are composed of three-dimensional, nanoporous nanofibers, oriented along the radial direction. The nanofibers have lengths of 300-1000 nm, diameters of 30-50 nm and a specific surface area of 286.4 m(2) g(-1). The effects of temperature and concentration on the morphology of the products were studied systematically, and the nanofiber growth mechanism was investigated. It was found that the nanostructure of Ni(OH)(2) could be changed from microspheres to nanoflakes, to nanofibers and nanoparticles, as the NiCl2 concentration is increased from 2 to 8 M, and for NH4OH concentrations from 10 to 14 M. The as-synthesized nanofibers exhibit excellent charge-discharge performance and the highest yet capacitance of 1271 F g(-1) for electrochemical supercapacitors, which is much higher than beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates (797 F g(-1)) and commercial Ni(OH)(2) powder (529.4 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) current density. The results indicate that as-synthesized hierarchical nanofibers, composed of mixed a-and beta-Ni(OH)(2) phases, are an excellent candidate for energy storage applications. The large-scale commercialization of our laboratory-produced nanofibers is also discussed.","2199":"Magnesium silicate double-walled hollow nanofibers (MSHNFs) with a hierarchical nanostructure have been successfully fabricated by combining the electrospinning technique with a hydrothermal method. The as-prepared MSHNFs are composed of numerous ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 10nm and have a high specific surface area (632.2m(2)g(-1)) and large pore volume (0.92cm(3)g(-1)). The MSHNFs exhibit high adsorption capacity and excellent stability in a purification test with organic molecules and a solution of heavy-metal ions. Moreover, the MSHNFs can be easily separated from solution by gravitational sedimentation owing to their unique structure.","2022":"The present article is a review of research works on promising applications of graphene and graphene-based nanostructures. It contains five main scientific subjects. The first one is the research on graphene-based transparent and flexible conductive films for displays and electrodes: efficient method ensuring uniform and controllable deposition of reduced graphene oxide thin films over large areas, large-scale pattern growth of graphene films for stretchble transparent electrodes, utilization of graphene-based transparent conducting films and graphene oxide-based ones in many photonic and optoelectronic devices and equipments such as the window electrodes of inorganic, organic and dye-sensitized solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, light-emitting electrochemical cells, touch screens, flexible smart windows, graphene-based saturated absorbers in laser cavities for ultrafast generations, graphene-based flexible, transparent heaters in automobile defogging\/deicing systems, heatable smart windows, graphene electrodes for high-performance organic field-effect transistors, flexible and transparent acoustic actuators and nanogenerators etc. The second scientific subject is the research on conductive inks for printed electronics to revolutionize the electronic industry by producing cost-effective electronic circuits and sensors in very large quantities: preparing high mobility printable semiconductors, low sintering temperature conducting inks, graphene-based ink by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in organic solutions, and developing inkjet printing technique for mass production of high-quality graphene patterns with high resolution and for fabricating a variety of good-performance electronic devices, including transparent conductors, embedded resistors, thin-film transistors and micro supercapacitors. The third scientific subject is the research on graphene-based separation membranes: molecular dynamics simulation study on the mechanisms of the transport of molecules, vapors and gases through nanopores in graphene membranes, experimental works investigating selective transport of different molecules through nanopores in single-layer graphene and graphene-based membranes toward the water desalination, chemical mixture separation and gas control. Various applications of graphene in bio-medicine are the contents of the fourth scientific subject of the review. They include the DNA translocations through nanopores in graphene membranes toward the fabrication of devices for genomic screening, in particular DNA sequencing; subnanometre trans-electrode membranes with potential applications to the fabrication of very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors; antibacterial activity of graphene, graphite oxide, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide; nanopore sensors for nucleic acid analysis; utilization of graphene multilayers as the gates for sequential release of proteins from surface; utilization of graphene-based electroresponsive scaffolds as implants for on-demand drug delivery etc. The fifth scientific subject of the review is the research on the utilization of graphene in energy storage devices: ternary self-assembly of ordered metal oxide-graphene nanocomposites for electrochemical energy storage; self-assembled graphene\/carbon nanotube hybrid films for supercapacitors; carbon-based supercapacitors fabricated by activation of graphene; functionalized graphene sheet-sulfure nanocomposite for using as cathode material in rechargeable lithium batteries; tunable three-dimensional pillared carbon nanotube-graphene networks for high-performance capacitance; fabrications of electrochemical micro-capacitors using thin films of carbon nanotubes and chemically reduced graphenes; laser scribing of high-performance and flexible graphene-based electrochemical capacitors; emergence of next-generation safe batteries featuring graphene-supported Li metal anode with exceptionally high energy or power densities; fabrication of anodes for lithium ion batteries from crumpled graphene-encapsulated Si nanoparticles; liquid-mediated dense integration of graphene materials for compact capacitive energy storage; scalable fabrication of high-power graphene micro-supercapacitors for flexible and on-chip energy storage; superior micro-supercapacitors based on graphene quantum dots; all-graphene core-sheat microfibres for all-solid-state, stretchable fibriform supercapacitors and wearable electronic textiles; micro-supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance based on three-dimensional graphene-carbon nanotube carpets; macroscopic nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogels for ultrafast capacitors; manufacture of scalable ultra-thin and high power density graphene electrochemical capacitor electrodes by aqueous exfoliation and spray deposition; scalable synthesis of hierarchically structured carbon nanotube-graphene fibers for capacitive energy storage; phosphorene-graphene hybrid material as a high-capacity anode material for sodium-ion batteries. Beside above-presented promising applications of graphene and graphene-based nanostructures, other less widespread, but perhaps not less important, applications of graphene and graphene-based nanomaterials, are also briefly discussed.","2585":"Functionalized graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hybrid hydrogels were prepared using a simple, facile and cost-effective strategy. GOQDs bearing different surface functional groups were introduced as the cross-linking agent into the PVA matrix thereby resulting in gelation. The four different types of hybrid hydrogels were prepared using graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, ester functionalized graphene oxide and amine functionalized GOQDs as cross-linking agents. It was observed that the hybrid hydrogel prepared with amine functionalized GOQDs was the most stable. The potential applicability of using this solid sensing platform has been subsequently explored in an easy, simple, effective and sensitive method for optical detection of M2+ (Fe2+, Co2+ and Cu2+) in aqueous media involving colorimetric detection. Amine functionalized GOQDs-PVA hybrid hydrogel when put into the corresponding solution of Fe2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ renders brown, orange and blue coloration respectively of the solution detecting the presence of Fe2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ ions in the solution. The minimum detection limit observed was 1 x 10(-7) M using UV-visible spectroscopy. Further, the applicability of the sensing material was also tested for a mixture of co-existing ions in solution to demonstrate the practical applicability of the system. Insight into the probable mechanistic pathway involved in the detection process is also being discussed.","4456":"Waste pulp residues are herein exploited for the synthesis of a sorbent for humic acid (HA), which is a major water pollutant. Cellulose pulp was etherified with a quaternary ammonium salt in water thereby introducing positive charges onto the surface of the pulp fibers, and subsequently mechanically disintegrated into high surface area cellulose nanofibers (CNF). CNF with three different charge contents were produced and their adsorption capacity towards HA was investigated with UV-spectrophotometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, and zeta-potential measurements. Substantial coverage of the CNF surface with HA in a wide pH range led to a reversal of the positive zeta-potentials of CNF suspensions. The HA adsorption capacity and the kinetics of HA uptake were found to be promoted by both acidic pH conditions and the surface charge content of CNF. It is suggested that HA adsorption onto CNF depends on electrostatic interactions between the two components, as well as on the conformation of HA. At pH similar to 6, up to 310 mg g(-1) of HA were adsorbed by the functionalized CNF, a substantially higher capacity than that of previously reported HA sorbents in the literature. It is further shown that CNF-HA complexes could be freeze-dried into \"soil-mimicking\" porous foams having good capacity to capture Cu(II) ions and positive dyes from contaminated water. Thus, the most abundant natural polymer, i.e., cellulose could effectively bind the most abundant natural organic matter for environmental remediation purpose.","3297":"Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are potential low-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of the much greater natural abundance of sodium salts. However, developing high-performance electrode materials for SIBs is a challenging task, especially due to the similar to 50% larger ionic radius of the Na+ ion compared to Lit, leading to vastly different electrochemical behavior. Metal phosphides such as FeP, CoP, NiP2, and CuP2 remain unexplored as electrode materials for SIBs, despite their high theoretical charge storage capacities of 900-1300 mAh g(-1). Here we report on the synthesis of metal phosphide nanocrystals (NCs) and discuss their electrochemical properties as anode materials for SIBs, as well as for LIBs. We also compare the electrochemical characteristics of phosphides with their corresponding sulfides, using the environmentally benign iron compounds, FeP and FeS2, as a case study. We show that despite the appealing initial charge storage capacities of up to 1200 mAh g(-1), enabled by effective nanosizing of the active electrode materials, further work toward optimization of the electrode\/electrolyte pair is needed to improve the electrochemical performance upon cycling.","469":"It is of vital importance to design stable and selective heterocatalysts for aqueous production of platforms from biomass-derived sugars. This paper describes a selective aqueous conversion of fructose to HMF using carbon catalysts from pulping waste sodium ligninsulfonate (SLS). The effect of carbonization atmospheres (N-2 flow, static air and air flow) on the structure, porosity, compositions and acidic properties of carbon catalysts were investigated by thermogravimetry-mass spectrum analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Boehm titrations, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and elemental analysis. The carbonization in air flow favored the formation of more oxygen-containing functional groups and micropores, while more sulfonic groups and meso-\/macro-pores were formed during carbonization in a static air atmosphere. Both oxygen-and sulfur-containing groups were acid sites, and their total amount was the largest when carbonized in air flow, followed by static air and N-2 flow. The positive correlation between the acid amounts and fructose conversion of carbon catalysts clearly demonstrated the catalytic effect of the acid sites. The steric hindrance of micropores in carbon catalysts restricted the formation of humins and promoted the HMF selectivity compared with meso-\/macro-pores.","5641":"Flexible free-standing carbonized cellulose-based hybrid film is integrately designed and served both as paper anode and as lightweight current collector for lithium-ion batteries. The well-supported heterogeneous nanoarchitecture is constructed from Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), carbonized cellulose nanofiber (C-CNF) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using by a pressured extrusion papermaking method followed by in situ carbonization under argon atmospheres. The in situ carbonization of CNF\/CNT hybrid film immobilized with uniform-dispersed LTO results in a dramatic improvement in the electrical conductivity and specific surface area, so that the carbonized paper anode exhibits extraordinary rate and cycling performance compared to the paper anode without carbonization. The flexible, lightweight, single-layer cellulose-based hybrid films after carbonization can be utilized as promising electrode materials for high-performance, low-cost, and environmentally friendly lithium-ion batteries.","1163":"Nanoscale scaffolds that characterize high bioactivity and the ability to deliver biomolecules provide a 3D microenvironment that controls and stimulates desired cellular responses and subsequent tissue reaction. Herein novel nanofibrous hybrid scaffolds of polycaprolactone shelled with mesoporous silica (PCL@MS) were developed. In this hybrid system, the silica shell provides an active biointerface, while the 3D nanoscale fibrous structure provides cell-stimulating matrix cues suitable for bone regeneration. The electrospun PCL-nanofibers were coated with MS at controlled thicknesses via a sol-gel approach. The MS Shell improved surface wettability and, ionic reactions, involving substantial, formation of bone-like mineral apatite in body-simulated medium. The MS-layered hybrid nanofibers showed a significant improvement in mechanical properties, in terms of both tensile strength and elastic modulus, as well as in nanomechanical surface behavior, which is favorable for hard tissue repair. Attachment, growth) and proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells were significantly improved on the hybrid scaffolds, and their osteogenic differentiation and subsequent mineralization were highly up-regulated by the hybrid scaffold's. Furthermore, the mesoporous surface of the hybrid scaffolds enabled the loading of a series of,bioactive molecules, including small drugs and proteins at high levels. The release of these molecules was sustainable over a long-term period, indicating the capability of the hybrid, scaffolds, to deliver therapeutic molecules. Taken together, the multifunctional hybrid nanofibrous scaffolds are considered to be promising therapeutic platforms for stimulating Stem cells and for the repair and regeneration of bone.","7313":"Hydrogels that change volume in response to specific molecular stimuli can serve as platforms for sensors, actuators and drug delivery devices. There is great interest in designing intelligent hydrogels for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and microfluidics that utilize protein binding specificities and conformational changes. Protein conformational change induced by ligand binding can cause volume phase transitions (VPTs). Here, we develop a highly selective glucose sensing protein photonic crystal (PC) hydrogel that is fabricated from genetically engineered E. coli glucose\/galactose binding protein (GGBP). The resulting 2-D PC-GGBP hydrogel undergoes a VPT in response to glucose. The volume change causes the 2-D PC array particle spacing to decrease, leading to a blue-shifted diffraction which enables our sensors to report on glucose concentrations. This 2-D PC-GGBP responsive hydrogel functions as a selective and sensitive sensor that easily monitors glucose concentrations from similar to 0.2 mu M to similar to 10 mM. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept for developing responsive, \"smart\" protein hydrogel materials with VPTs that utilize ligand binding induced protein conformational changes. This innovation may enable the development of other novel chemical sensors and high-throughput screening devices that can monitor protein-drug binding interactions.","5493":"A three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGOH) was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis based on the electrostatic force and chemical reaction between graphene oxide (GO) and Ni ions in a nickel acetate solution. The Ni- rGOH fabricated in this study exhibited a highly increased surface area compared to NiO nanoparticles owing to the formation of 3D networks. After the reduction of functional groups in Ni- GOH, Ni- rGOH showed highly enhanced capacitance (351 F g(-1)) at a charge\/ discharge current density of 0.625 A g(-1) and 90% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The energy density of Ni- rGOH was 175.5 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1.125 kW kg(-1), while maintaining a highenergy density of 118 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 4.5 kW kg(-1)","3932":"The goal of the paper was to prepare a class of flocculants by free-radical copolymerization of acrylamide with acrylic acid in aqueous solutions in the presence\/absence of potassium persulphate as initiator. Reaction medium was submitted to electron beam treatment of 0.6 to 1.5 kGy in atmospheric conditions and at room temperature. Because of the complexity of reaction mechanisms involved in radio-induced polymerization, was necessary to establish the connection between absorbed dose and initiator concentration, both of them very important in free radical production. Unlike the conversion coefficient and residual monomer concentration, intrinsic viscosity and Huggin's constant are sensitive to the initiator concentration variation for all used irradiation doses. The copolymerization was confirmed by FTIR measurements. The flocculation characteristics were evaluated in 0.2 wt % kaolin suspension at room temperature using different polymer dosages between 0 to 10 ppm. High flocculation efficiency was obtained using the polymer having high values of intrinsic viscosity, molecular weight and radius of gyration.","247":"Graphene-based nanocomposites have attracted considerable attention in photocatalytic research owing to their remarkable potential for the photodegradation of environmental pollutants. However, despite the progress made in this field, the development of visible-light-active photocatalysts with high activity and durability remains a challenge. In this work, bunches of Nb3O7(OH) nanorods wrapped in reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets were prepared by using a hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized Nb3O7(OH)-RGO nanocomposites was significantly enhanced compared to that of the pure Nb3O7(OH) nanostructures owing to their improved visible-light absorption and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Photoluminescence studies strongly supported the proposed charge separation and charge transport mechanism. Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiency was strongly dependent on the concentration of RGO in the nanocomposites. The highest photodegradation rate was obtained using the nanocomposite prepared with a graphene loading of 3 mg mL(-1), and when the RGO loading exceeded 3 mg mL(-1), the photodegradation efficiency decreased. This occurred because excess RGO nanosheets aggregated and hindered the absorption of incident light. We believe that this work provides invaluable information for the design of new efficient visible-light-active reduced graphene oxide-based photocatalysts to be used in water remediation through the oxidative degradation of organic dyes and toxic phenols.","5113":"The room temperature chemiresistive response of n-type ZnO nanowire (ZnO NWs) films modified with different thicknesses of p-type cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) has been studied. With increasing thickness of CoPc (>15 um), heterojunction films exhibit a transition from n- to p-type conduction due to uniform coating of CoPc on ZnO. Theheterojunction films prepared with a 25 nm thick CoPc layer exhibit the highest response (268% at 10 ppm of H2S) and the fastest response (26 s) among all samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and work function measurements reveal that electron transfer takes place from ZnO to CoPc, resulting in formation of a p-n junction with a barrier height of 0.4 eV and a depletion layer width of, similar to 8.9 nm. The detailed XPS analysis suggests that these heterojunction films with 25 nm thick CoPc exhibit the least content of chemisorbed oxygen, enabling the direct interaction of H2S with the CoPc molecule, and therefore exhibit the fastest response. The improved response is attributed to the high susceptibility of the p n junctions to the H2S gas, which manipulates the depletion layer width and controls the charge transport.","3038":"Pnicogen bond (ZB) is a new kind of intermolecular weak interaction, which would be an important strategy for the construction of supramolecular materials. In this paper, ab initio MP2\/aug-cc-pvDZ calculations have been carried out to characterize the X-Pa <-O ZB interactions between HCHO and PH2X (X=CH3, H, C6H5, F, Cl, Br, and NO2). The calculated interaction energies with basis set super-position error (BSSE) corrections in seven ZB complexes are between -7.51 and -20.36 kJa <...mol(-1). The relative stabilities of the seven complexes increase in the order: HCHOa <-PH2CH3 < HCHOa <-PH3 < HCHOa <-PH2C6H5 < HCHOa <-PH2Br < HCHOa <-PH2Cl < HCHOa <-PH2F < HCHOa <-PH2NO2. The natural bond orbital (NBO) and natural resonance theory (NRT) analysis were employed to investigate the electron behavior and nature of the ZBs. The natural bond orbital interactions in the ZBs are mainly LP (1,2)(O) ->sigma*(P-X). The P-X (X = Br, Cl, F and NO2) are more suitable for acting as ZB donors than the P-X (X =H, CH3 and C6H5) groups. The electron density topology properties based on atoms-inmolecules (AIM) theory showed that the ZB interactions in the HCHOa <-PH X-2 (X=Br, Cl, F and NO2) are stronger than those of HCHOa <-PH2X(X=CH3, H and C6H5) complexes, indicating that the electron withdrawing of X benefits for the stability of ZB structure.","761":"Nitrogen-carbon nanosheets (NCNS), composed of multi-layer graphene with turbostratic stacking, were successfully synthesized through a solution plasma processing (SPP) at room temperature and an atmospheric pressure. The plasma was generated in 200 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which was applied as the carbon and nitrogen precursors. The NCNS presented an electrical resistivity of 0.065 Omega cm, which is comparable with that of N-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The synthesis rate of NCNS was 20 mg min(-1). From the characteristics analyses, NCNS showed the surface area of 277 m(2) g(-1), a pore volume of 0.95 cm(3) g(-1) and a moderate nitrogen content of 1.3 at%. The synthesized NCNS also exhibited catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This unique synthesis method can be applicable to synthesize multiple types of heteroatom-carbon nanosheets.","1839":"Monodispersed hollow MnS nanospheres have been prepared through a solvothermal method using an imidazoline derivative as the morphology-directing reagent. The composition and morphology of synthesized MnS were characterized by powder XRD, SEM, and TEM. The MnS nanospheres were then mixed with chitosan and used as an immobilization matrix for redox protein of hemoglobin. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra showed that the configuration of hemoglobin in the composite film was well maintained. Electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the charge transfer process of Hb was greatly promoted by the MnS. The modified electrode also showed good electrocatalysis toward hydrogen peroxide with the linear range from 0.8 to 15.2 mu M. The detection limit and Michaelis-Menten constant were determined to be 0.092 and 4.33 mu M, respectively. When the biosensor was utilized for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in contact lens care solution, satisfactory results were obtained.","2276":"The production of carbon-based materials is a field of intense scientific research due to the diversity of potential applications that this kind of material presents. In this paper, it is reported the synthesis of porous carbonaceous material (PCM) based on the pyrolysis at 850 degrees C of a composite made of Laponite (commercially available synthetic clay) and Cassava starch, followed by clay removal through acid digestion. The Laponite presence influenced the structural order and textural properties of the pyrolytic carbon formed. After pyrolysis and acid digestion of clay, it was obtained a material with a partial graphitic structure containing majorly sp(2) bounded carbon atoms, that has almost twice the specific surface area and up to 20 times more mesopore volume than the carbonaceous material obtained without the clay. The adsorbent potential of PCM was evaluated by adsorption of Dicamba, an organochlorine pesticide, from aqueous solutions. The PCM exhibits a high Dicamba removal efficiency, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 251.9 mg g(-1) related to a pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption model with a strong pH dependence.

The carbon fibers in the aerogel present as a twisted and tubular structure. Depending on the amount of KOH used in the activation process, the specific surface area of aerogels ranges from 1536 to 2436 m(2) g(-1), while their electrical conductivity remains similar to 860 S m(-1). In spite of pore size in the range of 1.0-4.0 nm and pore volume mainly contributed by micropores, the carbon aerogel exhibits a high specific capacitance of 283 F g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and retains a high capacitance retention of 224 F g(-1) at current density up to 100 A g(-1). Importantly, a symmetric capacitor built with the aerogel electrodes exhibits a rather small time constant (0.56 s). The superior capacitive performance of a CF electrode is closely related to its distinct structural advantage. The tubular carbon fibers that are several millimeters in length offer ultralong electronic and ionic pathways, while plenty of nanopores on the fiber walls created by KOH activation enable fast ion transport across the walls. Our results demonstrate that capacitive performance of the traditional microporous carbon, which is characterized by poor ion kinetics, can be significantly enhanced by properly engineering the electrode architecture.","5406":"The efficient use of renewable resources (e.g., starch) is essential to the green economy. On the basis of commercially available microparticle retention and drainage systems, the process concept of trapping unmodified starch granules in mineral-filled cellulosic fiber networks for strength enhancement by incorporation of cationic polymer flocculant pretreated\/bridged starch granules in combination with the use of an anionic microparticulate material was discussed and demonstrated. Specifically, a high molecular weight cationic polyacrylamide and a modified bentonite, which are commercially available in the market, were used as the polymer flocculant and the anionic microparticulate material, respectively. The paper strength loss upon the addition of precipitated calcium carbonate filler particles was significantly mitigated by employing such a concept, which may provide an alternative strategy for improving the strength properties of mineral-filled paper grades.","5397":"Hyaluronan lyase from Streptococcus pneumoniae can degrade hyaluronic acid, which is one of the major components in the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronan can regulate water balance, osmotic pressure, and act as an ion exchange resin. Followed by our recent work on the catalytic reaction mechanism and substrate binding mode, we in this work further investigate the functional role of active site arginine residue, R462, in the degradation of hyaluronan. The site directed mutagenesis simulation of R462A and R462Q were modeled using a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical method. The overall substrate binding features upon mutations do not have significant changes. The energetic profiles for the reaction processes are essentially the same as that in wild type enzyme, but significant activation barrier height changes can be observed. Both mutants were shown to accelerate the overall enzymatic activity, e.g., R462A can reduce the barrier height by about 2.8 kcal mol(-1), while R462Q reduces the activation energy by about 2.9 kcal mol(-1). Consistent with the active site model calculated using density functional theory, our results can support that the positive charge on R462 guanidino side chain group plays a negative role in the catalysis. Finally, the functional role of R462 was proposed to facilitate the formation of initial enzyme-substrate complex, but not in the subsequent catalytic degradation reaction.","3479":"Cr(VI) is removed efficiently from aqueous solution using Chitosan made films as the adsorbent. The efficiency of free Chitosan films is compared with the Chitosan-Silica and Chitosan-Carbon, which are reinforced with biogenic Silica and Carbon obtained from Panicum miliare husk ashes, respectively. All the films were prepared by simple ageing method and swelling index was determined for all the three adsorbents independently. Adsorption studies of Cr(VI) heavy metal were carried out by varying pH, temperature, initial concentration of the adsorbate and quantity of adsorbent. On the otherhand, Cr(VI) was removed from the solution by Chitosan-Silica film better than free Chitosan and Chitosan-Carbon films. The optimum pH was found to be 3.0 and optimum temperature was 30 degrees C. Thermodynamic, equilibrium and kinetic studies were carried out for all the three adsorbents, independently. Langmuir adsorption isotherm and Pseudo First Order kinetics were followed for the adsorption process. Concentration of metal ions was determined using a spectrophotometer. Oxidation states of the adsorbed Cr were determined by ESR. It was found that Chitosan-Silica film reduced Cr(VI) to Cr(III) almost completely in the aqueous solution.","1706":"A self-powered active strain sensor based on well-aligned (K,Na)NbO3 piezoelectric nanofibers is successfully fabricated through the electrospinning and polymer packaging process. The device exhibits a fast, active response to dynamic strain by generating impulsive voltage signal that is dependent on the amplitude of the dynamic strains and the vibration frequency. When the frequency is fixed at 1 Hz, the peak to peak value of the voltage increases from similar to 1 to similar to 40 mV, and the strain changes from 1 to 6%. Furthermore, the output voltage is linearly increased by an order of magnitude with the frequency changing from 0.2 to 5 Hz under the same strain amplitude. The influence of frequency on the output voltage can be further enhanced at higher strain amplitude. This phenomenon is attributed to the increased generating rate of piezoelectric charges under higher strain rate of the nanofibers. By counting the pulse separation of the voltage peaks, the vibration frequency is synchronously measured during the sensing process. The accuracy of the sensing results can be improved by calibration according to the frequency-dependent sensing behavior.","6775":"A hydrogel based on sulfobetaine methacrylate monomer N-(methacryloyloxyethyl)-N, N-dimethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine and N, N-bis(methacryloyloxyethyl)-N-methyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine used as a crosslinker was investigated as a potential material for biosensor applications. The glucose diffusion coefficient of 1.2 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1) was determined from the glucose release experiment. Inverse size-exclusion chromatography was performed to determine the molecular weight cut-off of the hydrogel to be 8 kDa with respect to pullulans that corresponds to a viscosity radius of 2.1 nm. The narrow pore-size distribution suggests that using the sulfobetaine crosslinker suppresses the composition drift and results in a homogeneous hydrogel network. Furthermore, a glucose biosensor construct comprising the periplasmic glucose-binding protein of Escherichia coli fused to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins was effectively entrapped in the hydrogel exhibiting no leakage for at least 7 days. The glucose-binding protein showed stability of its secondary structure and sensitivity to glucose as assessed by circular dichroism and Forster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer measurements under physiological conditions and a physiological range of glucose concentration, respectively.","4022":"In this work we demonstrated the effective use of gamma irradiation for useful chemical conversion. Thus, graphene oxide was reduced to graphene upon exposure to gamma irradiation. The resulting gamma irradiated graphene (GIG) and graphene-covered steel were characterized using UV-Vis, XRD spectroscopies and FE-SEM. Corrosion protection of austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 by GIG and gamma irradiated graphene\/chitosan (GIG\/CS) composite films in 3.5% NaCl solution was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The protection efficiencies for GIG and GIG\/CS were 82.2% and 89%, respectively. GIG\/CS films over steel showed higher corrosion activation energies compared to GIG. EIS proved the stability of GIG and GIG\/CS coatings after different immersion times in 3.5% NaCl solution. Coated surfaces were free from pits on the scale of magnification as demonstrated from SEM images. The pitting corrosion behavior of uncoated and GIG-coated surfaces was also studied.","228":"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of organic\/conventional coffee in liver tissues in the cancer process, taking into account the level and activities of catalase. The experiments were carried out with 8 groups of rats during 12 weeks. They received two injections of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution 1.5% (v\/v) prepared in 0.9% NaCl or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) subcutaneous dose of 40 mg.kg(-1).bw(-1) for 2 weeks. The organic\/conventional coffee infusions were at 5, 10, and 20% and were incorporated to feed (100 mL of infusion.kg(-1) of diet). The catalase activity showed a decrease for livers which received DMH and DMH plus organic coffee at 5% and 10%. However, an increase was observed for those receiving organic 20% and conventional 10% coffee, slowing down and favoring the reversibility of the carcinogenic process. By SDS-PAGE, we observed an intensity decrease of 59 kDa bands, as the percentage of coffee was increased. The iron concentration (by ET-AAS) confirmed the electrophoretic results, suggesting that the DMH influenced the catalase expression conditions, reducing the activity by the loss of iron ions. Thus, the coffee may restore the catalase system in the liver, exerting its chemopreventive effects.","7271":"Magnetically separable poultry chicken feathers were found to be an efficient, green and heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols and sulfides to the corresponding carbonyl compounds and sulfoxides, respectively using t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as oxidant with complete selectivity and high conversions. The developed catalyst exhibited higher stability, activity and better recycling ability than the bare magnetic nanoparticles. The designed catalyst could readily be recovered using an external magnet without showing any significant leaching during the reaction.","6722":"We explored the energy transfer dynamics of chlorophyll-aentrapped polyacrylamide hydrogel with a vision of applying this hybrid material in a bio-inspired light harvesting system. Prominent photocurrent response was observed from a simple photovoltaic assembly prepared by encapsulating the hydrogel within two electrodes. For a better understanding of the energy transport, the hybrid systems were synthesized via two different methods (in situ and swelling induced). The difference in photocurrent efficiency among the two systems could be correlated with the different dynamic behaviors of the various excitonic packets and could be explained with environment-assisted transport of photosynthesis (ENAQT). This theory predicts that energy migration in a natural photosystem relies on the balance between coherence and dephasing, owing to the respective packing geometry. Fluorescence anisotropy supports the swollen induced arrangement of chlorophyll-a packets, which are inter-connected in terms of overlapping in site energy, as evident from the broadening of the UV-Vis spectra wherein coherent spreading occurs among around 4 chlorophyll-a molecules, as revealed from the time correlated single photon count. Exciton localization within the packets is destroyed by low frequency noise to mitigate coherence trapping in a coherent classical intermediate fashion, similar to ENAQT in natural photosynthesis, resulting in greater photocurrent efficiency. Optical and photo-physical properties of the in situ sample show that charged dimers are randomly spread throughout the system. As a result, delocalization is destroyed and energy propagation becomes less effective as the exciton is more likely to recombine than trap. The experimental signature of the environment-assisted energy transfer is further supported by a simple mathematical formulation inspired from Kassal's work. The concept of using swollen induced bio-inspired soft materials for solar energy harvesting can pave the way towards a new class of biomimetic solar cell.","17":"With global concerns about the shortage of fossil fuels and environmental issues, the development of efficient and clean energy storage devices has been drastically accelerated. Nanofibers are used widely for energy storage devices due to their high surface areas and porosities. Electrospinning is a versatile and efficient fabrication method for nanofibers. In this review, we mainly focus on the application of electrospun nanofibers on energy storage, such as lithium batteries, fuel cells, dye-sensitized solar cells and supercapacitors. The structure and properties of nanofibers are also summarized systematically. The special morphology of nanofibers prepared by electrospinning is significant to the functional materials for energy storage.","1515":"The aim of this study was to construct a nanostructured lipid system as a strategy to improve the in vitro antibacterial activity of copper( II) complexes. New compounds with the general formulae [ CuX2( INH) 2] center dot nH(2)O ( X = Cl - and n = 1 ( 1); X = NCS - and n = 5 ( 2); X = NCO - and n = 4 ( 3); INH = isoniazid, a drug widely used to treat tuberculosis) derived from the reaction between the copper( II) chloride and isoniazid in the presence or absence of pseudohalide ions ( NCS - or NCO -) were synthesized and characterized by infrared spectrometry, electronic absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, melting points and complexometry with 2,2 1,2 1 1,2 1 1 1 -( Ethane- 1,2- diyldinitrilo) tetraacetic acid ( EDTA). The characterization techniques allowed us to confirm the formation of the copper( II) complexes. The Cu( II) complexes were loaded into microemulsion ( MEs) composed of 10% phase oil ( cholesterol), 10% surfactant [ soy oleate and Brij (R) 58 ( 1: 2)] and 80% aqueous phase ( phosphate buffer pH = 7.4) prepared by sonication. The Cu( II) complex- loaded MEs displayed sizes ranging from 158.0 +\/- 1.060 to 212.6 +\/- 1.539 nm, whereas the polydispersity index ( PDI) ranged from 0.218 +\/- 0.007 to 0.284 +\/- 0.034. The antibacterial activity of the free compounds and those that were loaded into the MEs against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC (R) 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC (R) 25922, as evaluated by a microdilution technique, and the cytotoxicity index ( IC50') against the Vero cell line ( ATCC (R) CCL- 81TM) were used to calculate the selectivity index ( SI). Among the free compounds, only compound 2 ( MIC 500 mu g\/ mL) showed activity for S. aureus. After loading the compounds into the MEs, the antibacterial activity of compounds 1, 2 and 3 was significantly increased against E. coli ( MIC's 125, 125 and 500 mu g\/ mL, respectively) and S. aureus ( MICs 250, 500 and 125- g\/ mL, respectively). The loaded compounds were less toxic against the Vero cell line, especially compound 1 ( IC50 from 109.5 to 319.3 mu g\/ mL). The compound 2- and 3- loaded MEs displayed the best SI for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. These results indicated that the Cu( II) complex- loaded MEs were considerably more selective than the free compounds, in some cases, up to 40 times higher.","6134":"Mercaptans are the main compounds in petroleum derivatives that are tried to be removed. In this work, Infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics were utilized to evaluate the analytical and kinetics characteristics of adsorption of 1-butyl mercaptan from n-hexane by Ni coated carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Electroless plating was applied for coating of Ni on CNFs. Three types of adsorbents with different amounts of coated nickel were studied and compared to investigate the effect of nickel amount on modification of the surface of the adsorbent to obtain higher capacity and rate of desulfurization. In order to obtain useful information about the adsorption process, multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) chemometrics method was used. Information about the variations in concentration of 1-butyl mercaptan and kinetics of adsorption was achieved. This study showed that the adsorbent with higher amount of coated nickel had higher rate constant of adsorption. Also, relative concentrations of 1-butyl mercaptan were calculated in different times during adsorption process.","7487":"Kraft lignin can be extracted from black liquor (i.e., spent liquor) of a haft pulping process to produce value-added chemicals, but its limited water solubility hampers its end-use applications. The main objective of this study was to investigate the sulfomethylation of haft lignin to produce water-soluble haft lignin with an anionic charge density. In this work, hardwood haft lignin was modified with formaldehyde and sodium sulfite under alkali conditions. The optimum conditions for sulfomethylation were 0.5 M NaOH(aq), 0.9 mol\/mol sodium hydroxymethyl sulfonate\/lignin at 100 degrees C for 3 h, and 20 g\/L lignin concentration. The resulting lignin had a charge density of -1.60 mequiv\/g and sulfonate group content of 1.48 mmol\/g. The molecular weight, structure, thermal behavior, and elemental analyses of the product were also assessed. The modified lignin was used as a cement dispersant, and the dispersibility of cement was increased from 60 to 155 mm by adding 1.2 wt % of sulfomethylated lignin to cement. Unmodified lignin did not change the dispersibility of cement.","6449":"This study reports a self-healable hydrogel electrolyte based on dynamic diol-borate ester bonding for smart electrochemical capacitors (ECs). The electrolyte is prepared via converting polyacrylic acid grafted polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-g-PAA) into a hydrogel in the presence of KCl and borax. The resulting PVA-g-PAA\/KCl hydrogel electrolyte exhibits not only good flexibility but also high ionic conductivity up to 41 mS cm(-1). Interestingly, once the electrolyte is cut, it spontaneously restores its configuration, mechanical properties and ionic conductivity within 20 min. The self-healing process takes place at least 15 times under mild conditions without any external stimulus. Based on this unique capability, a smart electrochemical capacitor with self-healable and tailorable characteristics is assembled. The present investigation offers a novel strategy to synthesize self-healable hydrogel electrolytes that might be applied to flexible, wearable and smart energy-storage devices.","5612":"Free-standing activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) were prepared through electrospinning combining with CO2 activation and then used for nonaqueous Li-O-2 battery cathodes. As-prepared ACNF based cathode was loosely packed with carbon nanofibers complicatedly overlapped. Owing to some micrometer-sized pores between individual nanofibers, relatively high permeability of O-2 across the cathode becomes feasible. Meanwhile, the mesopores introduced by CO2 activation act as additional nucleation sites for Li2O2 formation, leading to an increase in the density of Li2O2 particles along with a size decrease of the individual particles, and therefore, flake-like Li2O2 are preferentially formed. In addition, the free-standing structure of ACNF cathode eliminates the side reactions about PVDF. As a result, the Li-O-2 batteries with ACNF cathodes showed increased discharge capacities, reduced overpotentials, and longer cycle life in the case of full discharge and charge operation. This provides a novel pathway for the design of cathodes for Li-O-2 battery.","2431":"To end the unsustainable disposal of pyrolysis fuel oil (PFO), which is a type of petrochemical waste, we investigate the use of PFO as a carbon source for soft carbon and evaluate it as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. This material exhibites a much higher reversible capacity (366.5 mAh g(-1)) than that of commercial soft carbon (236.4 mAh g(-1)) and an extremly stable cyclability. The PFO-derived soft carbon retained 99.0% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, and a rate capability test indicated that it retained a higher capacity at all investigated current densities compared with that of a commercial product. To further improve its lithium storage capacity, the PFO-derived soft carbon was composited with nano silicon. Notably, even after the composite was formed, the high rate capability was maintained. It was demonstrated that petrochemical waste can be converted into high-performance anode material, and this sustainable approach is readily applicable to the commercial production of anode material.

To date, MEBs have only been prepared from solutions containing chloride salts, owing to their relevance in natural salinity gradients created from seawater and freshwater. We hypothesized that MEBs could capture energy using ammonium bicarbonate (AmB), a thermolytic salt that can be used to convert waste heat into salinity gradients. We examined six battery electrode materials. Several of the electrodes were unstable in AmB solutions or failed to produce expected voltages. Of the electrode materials tested, a cell containing a manganese oxide electrode and a metallic lead electrode produced the highest power density (6.3 mW m(-2)). However, this power density is still low relative to previously reported NaCl-based MEBs and heat recovery systems. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that MEBs could indeed be used to generate electricity from AmB salinity gradients.","6012":"Nanostructured TiO2 and TiO2@C nanocomposites were prepared by an original process combining biotemplating and mineralization of aerogels of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). A direct one step treatment of NFC with TiCl4 in strictly anhydrous conditions allows TiO2 formation at the outermost part Of the nanofibrils while preserving their shape and size. Such TiO2@cellulose composites can be transformed into TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NT) by calcination in air at 600 and 900 degrees C, or into TiO2@C nanocomposites by pyrolysis in argon at 600 and 900 degrees C.

The as-obtained NiO-NFs\/Ni is used as a binder-free electrode in supercapacitors and its electrochemical performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge\/discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that the binder-free NiO-NFs\/Ni electrode can offer reasonably high specific capacitance (737 Fg(-1) at 2 Ag-1), excellent rate capability with capacitance retention as high as 570 Fg(-1) even at 40 Ag-1, and very good cycling stability at various rates up to 8000 cycles. The excellent performance can be attributed to the porous nature of both the NiO-NFs and Ni foam current collector as well as the binder-free feature of the electrode, which greatly facilitate the ion and electron transport in the electrode.

Current energy storage demands are not being met with existing materials, however, because of their defects, such as fast capacity fading, low rate capability, and low specific capacity in practical applications. Manganese dissolution during electrochemical processes bears the major responsibility for capacity loss, apart from the electrolyte factor. Low electrical conductivity, low ionic diffusion efficiency, and large structural variation have adverse effects on the electrochemical performance of materials. With respect to these drawbacks, significant progress has been made recently on optimizing the performance of LMO-based cathode materials.

Herein, we demonstrated that increasing rigidness of carbon coating by incorporating the analogue of Al oxide was able to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of Co3O4. Compared with carbon coating, a hybrid coating consisted of carbon and the analogue of Al oxide (COAl) showed increased rigidness and robustness, which can suppress the massive expansion of Co3O4 upon lithiation, and accordingly, a conductive linkage of carbon over the electrode surface could be well preserved by using a thin hybrid coating. In this way, good electrode integration was obtained together with fast electric conduction and short Li+ diffusion distance. AFM force curve, SEM observation and impedance measurement were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy. During the tests of Li-ion batteries, C@Co3O4@COAl exhibited significantly improved rate capability (0.2-20 A g(-1)) and cycling stability (4000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) as compared with C@Co3O4@C, thus manifesting the significant role by increasing the rigidness of carbon coating.

Amyloid fibrils of hen lysozyme, which are highly ordered protein nanofibers, can be prepared easily in one step under green and mild aqueous conditions. Results of zeta-potential and fluorescence measurements indicate that lysozyme nanofibers bear positive\/negative charges and hydrophobic regions along their fibrillar structures. These special structural properties enable lysozyme nanofibers to adsorb the anionic dyes Reactive Black 5 and Acid Blue 29 and the cationic dye Victoria Blue B rapidly and efficiently, presumably through multiple intermolecular interactions (e.g. electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction); the adsorption equilibrium for these dyes can be reached within 15 min, and a dye removal efficiency of over 60% can be achieved in industrial wastewater. Lysozyme nanofibers are also compatible with magnetite nanoparticles to form magnetic nanofibers, which can provide rapid and convenient dye removals through the application of an external magnetic field and maintain high dye removal efficiency (92-99%) after undergoing 20 cycles of desorption.","4786":"We report on the fabrication and characterization of versatile light waveguides exploiting filaments of a polar liquid confined within hydrophobic silica aerogels. Aerogels are highly porous materials with extremely low refractive index which makes them suitable as rigid cladding of liquid-core optofluidic waveguides based on total internal reflection of light. In this article, we introduce a new microfabrication technique that allows direct and precise processing of monolithic silica aerogels by ablation with femtosecond laser pulses. Using fast scanning of the focused laser ablation beam synchronized with the motion of the processed aerogel sample, we created high-quality straight microchannels of similar to 5 mm length with controlled cross-sections inside monolithic aerogels. After the ablation, we filled the channels with high-refractive index ethylene glycol, forming multimode liquid core - solid cladding optofluidic waveguides. Subsequently, we carried out light-guiding experiments to measure overall optical attenuation of these waveguides. The characterization of waveguide transmission yielded values of propagation losses lower than 10 dB cm(-1), demonstrating that the liquid-core waveguides with laser-ablated aerogel cladding represent an attractive alternative in optofluidic applications targeting controlled routing of light along arbitrary three-dimensional paths.

In this report, a general and facile strategy to combat surface fouling is developed by grafting of amino acids onto polymer substrates to form zwitterionic structure through amino groups induced epoxy ring opening click reaction. First of all, a library of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) hydrogels with zwitterionic surfaces were prepared, resulting in the formation of pairs of carboxyl anions and protonated secondary amino cations. The analysis of attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the successful immobilization of amino acids on the hydrogel surfaces. After that, the contact angle and equilibrium water content of the modified hydrogels showed that the hydrogels exhibited improved hydrophilicity compared with the parent hydrogel. Furthermore, the protein deposition was evaluated by bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme as models. The results indicated that the performance of the hydrogels was determined by the nature of incorporated amino acid: the hydrogels incorporated with neutral amino acids had nonspecific antiadsorption capability to both BSA and lysozyme; the hydrogels incorporated with charged amino acids showed antiadsorption behaviors against protein with same charge and enhanced adsorption to the protein with opposite charge; the optimal antiadsorption performance was observed on the hydrogels incorporated with polar amino acids with a hydroxyl residual. The improvement of antiprotein fouling of the neutral amino acids grafted hydrogels can be ascribed to the formation of zwitterionic surfaces. Finally, a couple of soft contact lenses grafted with amino acids were fabricated having improved antifouling property and hydrophilicity. The result demonstrated the success of amino acids based zwitterionic antifouling strategy in ophthalmology. This strategy is also applicable to substrates including filtration membranes, microspheres and nanofibers as well. It is a versatile method for amino acids grafting onto polymer substrates to construct zwitterionic surfaces and achieve antifouling properties.","3049":"A plastic and biodegradable bone substitute consists of poly (l-lactic-co-glycolic) acid and 30 wt % -tricalcium phosphate has been previously fabricated, but its osteogenic capability required further improvement. We investigated the use of globular adiponectin (gAPN) as an anabolic agent for tissue-engineered bone using this scaffold. A qualitative analysis of the bone regeneration process was carried out using CT and histological analysis 12 weeks after implantation. CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) superimposition was used to characterise the effect of the different treatments on bone formation. In this study, we also explored adiponectin's (APN) influence on primary cultured human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells gene expressions involved in the osteogenesis. We found that composite scaffolds loaded with gAPN or bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) exhibited significantly increased bone formation and mineralisation following 12 weeks in the extraction sockets of beagle dogs, as well as enhanced expression of osteogenic markers. In vitro investigation revealed that APN also promoted osteoblast differentiation of primary cultured human jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (h-JBMMSCs), accompanied by increased activity of alkaline phosphatase, greater mineralisation, and production of the osteoblast-differentiated genes osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and collagen type I, which was reversed by APPL1 siRNA. Therefore, the composite scaffold loaded with APN exhibited superior activity for guided bone regeneration compared with blank control or Bio-Oss((R)) (a commercially available product). The composite scaffold with APN has significant potential for clinical applications in bone tissue engineering.","2646":"Polypyrrole (PPy), as one of the conducting polymers, has emerged as a promising active material for high performance supercapacitor owing to its intrinsic characteristics (e.g. high electrical conductivity and interesting redox properties). It's attracting more and more attentions with the development of flexible\/wearable devices thanks to the great flexibility and ductility of PPy as a polymer. This review presents a comprehensive understanding on synthesis, morphology control, electrochemical performances and solid-state devices of the nanostructured PPy and its nanocomposites. In the past decades, a variety of nanostructures, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional, have been designed and fabricated via different methods, demonstrating a great potential for the application as supercapacitor electrodes. Thereafter, many nanostructured PPy-based supercapacitors with different macroscopic configurations have been presented aiming to achieve better electrochemical performance, and some representative ones, for example, flexible and\/or wearable supercapacitors, are summarized in this review. Cycling stability is another critical issue that determines its practicability of the PPy-based devices. Solutions to improve cycling performance and mechanisms behind are also discussed.

Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the specific capacitance of the resulting ternary composite is 572 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) using a three-electrode system, which is significantly higher than that of pure PANI and the binary graphene-PANI composite. In addition, over 88.54% of the initial capacitance can be retained after repeating tests for 10 000 cycles, demonstrating a high cycling stability. The extraordinary electrochemical performance of the ternary GAP nanocomposite is attributed to its well-designed nanostructure and the synergistic effects among individual components.","4003":"We investigated formation of carbon nanofibers grown by chemical deposition (CVD) method using an acetylene-hydrogen mixture on the surface of micron-sized aluminum powder particles. To obtain uniform distribution of the carbon nanostructures on the particles we deposited nickel catalyst on the surface by spraying from the aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. It was found that increasing the time of the synthesis lowers the rate of growth of carbon nanostructures due to the deactivation of the catalyst. The Raman spectroscopy measurements confirm the presence of disordered carbon corresponding to CNFs in the specimen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the presence of aluminum carbide in the hot pressed samples. An aluminum composite material prepared using 1 wt.% CNFs obtained by uniaxial cold pressing and sintering showed 30 % increase in the hardness compared to pure aluminum, whereas the composites prepared by hot pressing showed 80 % increase in the hardness. Composite materials have satisfactory ductility. Thus, the aluminum based material reinforced with carbon nanostructures should be appropriate for creating high-strength and light compacts for aerospace and automotive applications and power engineering.","3960":"Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) with carbon nanotube@nickel hydroxide nanosheet (CNT@Ni(OH)(2)) core-shell composites as positive electrodes and three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks (3DGNs) as negative electrodes were reported in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The CNT@Ni(OH)(2) core-shell composites were prepared through a facile chemical bath deposition method, while 3DGNs were obtained by freeze-drying of graphene hydrogels. By virtue of their unique microstructures, superb electrochemical properties were achieved in a three-electrode system, e.g., 1136 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) for the CNT@Ni(OH)(2) electrode within 0-0.5 V and 203 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) for the 3DGN electrode within -1-0 V. Benefiting from these merits, the as-fabricated CNT@Ni(OH)(2)\/\/3DGN ASC showed a maximum energy density of 44.0 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1) and even retained 19.6 W h kg(-1) at 16 000 W kg-(1) in the voltage region of 0-1.6 V.","5926":"Two peroxidase (POX) forms, named PdPI and PdPII, were partially purified from the Pithecellobium dulce aril, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. Zymography of the proteins obtained after precipitation in the range of 60-90% ammonium sulfate (F6090 fraction) showed two bands with peroxidase activity. In DE-52 cellulose column, the peroxidase activity was detected in unadsorbed peak (PdPI) and adsorbed peak eluted with 0.2 mol L-1 NaCl (PdPII) suggesting that PdPI (similar to 114 KDa) and PdPII (similar to 77 KDa) are basic and acidic proteins, respectively, being PdPI stable at 80 degrees C. This is the first report of partial purification of POX from P. dulce aril, indicating that this species may be a new source of enzymes for use in biosensors and other biotechnological applications.","6402":"Hantzsch dihydropyridine-based ratiometric fluorescent NO probes, viz. PyNO and TPANO, were synthesized and characterized. These two probes were shown to be selective and sensitive for NO among the reactive oxygen\/nitrogen species (ROS\/RNS) studied in HEPES buffer medium by absorption, fluorescence, and visual color change with detection limits of 2.6 mu M and 0.08 mu M, respectively. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with Hantzsch dihydropyridines to give the corresponding intensely fluorescent product pyridines via aerobic oxidation and this is applied to detect nitric oxide (NO). A reaction mechanism for dihydropyridine with NO is proposed in this study. The probe shows good stability over a broad pH range (pH > 4). The structures of the PyNO and TPANO probes have been established by single-crystal XRD. DFT and TDDFT calculations were done to demonstrate the electronic properties of the probes and their aromatic products. Moreover, the utility of the PyNO and TPANO probes in detecting NO in live cells has also been demonstrated using Vero cells as monitored by fluorescence imaging. A study of the detection of endogenously generated NO was also carried out by increasing the incubation time of the probe with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pre-treated cells and it was found that a highly fluorescent cell image could be obtained.","3303":"Locoregional recurrence of cervical cancer following surgical resection remains a severe clinical problem. To reduce tumor replase rate with more efficacy and safety, local combination chemotherapy may has advantages over mono-chemotherapy or systemic chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of electrospun nanofibers co-loaded with cisplatin and curcumin to prevent local recurrence of cervical cancer after surgery. From in vitro tests, the combination of cisplatin and curcumin achieved a synergetic effect in growth inhibition and apoptosis induction of HeLa cells. From in vivo trails, local implantation of nanofibers enabled both drugs to be highly accumulated at the surgical site with an optimum concentration ratio between the two drugs. When used in the prevention of U14 cervical cancer recurrence in mice, nanofiber-based local combination chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than systemic combination chemotherapy, indicating its great clinical potential in the future.","877":"Acoustic emission monitoring was applied for the detection of xylophagous insects and more specifically oligomerus and relative species in wooden cultural heritage musical instruments kept in European museums where the temperature and hygrometry are controlled according to International Council of Museums (ICOM) rules. Using broadband high frequency sensors [75-1000 kHz] and a high level of amplification to compensate the acoustic attenuation in wood, it is possible to detect the presence of very small larvae (1-2 mm length) in a wooden object. Different coupling materials which respect conservation rules have been tested to fix the sensor to the artefact with an optimized signal to noise ratio. Such coupling materials must not damage the surface of the object and must enable a reversible operation. Since the acoustic signal (frequency and amplitude) depends on the distance between the sensor and the source, robust data processing based on an orthogonal linear transformation is then applied to the recorded signals to distinguish insect signals from ambient noise.

Miniemulsions with aqueous nanodroplets containing different enzymes, i.e. lipase or alpha-chymotrypsin, and a fluorophore are electrospun with a solution of poly(ester amide) and polycaprolactone to fabricate multicompartment nanofibers. The poly(ester amide) contains the two essential amino acids phenylalanine and leucine that promote low cytotoxicity degradation products and makes them suitable for the preparation of drug delivery devices for the biomedical field. The activity of the loaded enzymes in different conditions and a sustained degradation of fibers mechanism with an approximate 20% weight loss within one month are observed. Locating enzymes in degradation medium accelerated the degradation until complete scaffold destruction in less than 5 days. In all cases, a nearly complete release of the loaded fluorophore (from 80% and upwards) was achieved before the complete degradation of fibers occurred, suggesting that the nanofibers are suitable as self-triggered drug release systems with sustained mechanical integrity and a flexible range of degradation rates.","5688":"Hydrogen is a promising energy vector for storing renewable energies: obtained from water-splitting, in electrolysers or photoelectrochemical cells, it can be turned back to electricity on demand in fuel cells (FCs). Proton exchange membrane (PEM) devices with low internal resistance, high compactness and stability are an attractive technology optimized over decades, affording fast start-up times and low operating temperatures. However, they rely on the powerful catalytic properties of noble metals such as platinum, while lower cost, more abundant materials would be needed for economic viability. Replacing these noble metals at both electrodes has long proven to be a difficult task, so far incompatible with PEM technologies. Here we take advantage of newly developed bio-inspired molecular H-2 oxidation catalysts and noble metal-free O-2-reducing materials, to fabricate a noble metal-free PEMFC, with an 0.74 V open circuit voltage and a 23 mu W cm(-2) output power under technologically relevant conditions.

The ultralightweight, high-surface-area sponges exhibit excellent mechanical stability and enhanced absorption of organic contaminants such as oils and dye molecules. Additionally, these biocomposite sponges display significant cellular biocompatibility, which opens new prospects in biomedical uses.

Thus, it is of great importance to determine early neuronal changes that may contribute to disease progression. Recent attention has focused on lipids and their role in pro- and anti-apoptotic processes. However, information regarding the lipid alterations in animal models of PD is lacking. In this study, we utilized high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS\/MS) and novel HPLC solvent methodology to profile phosphatidylcholines and sphingolipids within the substantia nigra. The ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta was collected from rats 21 days after an infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or vehicle into the anterior dorsal striatum. We identified 115 lipid species from their mass\/charge ratio using the LMAPS Lipid MS Predict Database. Of these, 19 lipid species (from phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphotidylcholine lipid classes) were significantly altered by 6-OHDA, with most being down-regulated. The two lipid species that were up-regulated were LPC (16:0) and LPC (18:1), which are important for neuroinflammatory signalling. These findings provide a first step in the characterization of lipid changes in early stages of PD-like pathology and could provide novel targets for early interventions in PD.","2183":"By mimicking natural lignin degradation systems, the Fenton catalyst (Fe3+, H2O2) can effectively facilitate lignin depolymerization in supercritical ethanol (7MPa, 250 degrees C) to give organic oils that consist of mono- and oligomeric aromatics, phenols, dicarboxylic acids, and their derivatives in yields up to (66.0 +\/- 8.5)%. The thermal properties, functional groups, and surface chemistry of lignin before and after Fenton treatment were examined by thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, (PNMR)-P-31 spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results suggest that the Fenton catalyst facilitates lignin depolymerization through cleavage of -ether bonds between lignin residues. The formation of a lignin-iron chelating complex effectively depresses lignin recondensation; thus minimizing charcoal formation and enhancing the yield of liquid products.","5414":"The contamination of aqueous systems with phosphates has considerable environmental concerns and here, we present a new method for phosphate removal based on graphene aerogel composites. 3-Dimensional graphene aerogels decorated with goethite (alpha FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were synthesised and their application in capturing phosphates in water was successfully demonstrated. The prepared aerogels showed superior capacity to remove up to 350 mg g(-1) at an initial phosphate concentration of 200 mg L-1 from water. The Freundlich model was suitable to describe the adsorption mechanism of phosphate removal by the graphene-iron nanoparticle aerogels through both mononuclear and polynuclear adsorption onto the nanosized aFeOOH and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. These new phosphate adsorbents can be produced in different forms and dimensions, using a simple, green and scalable process, and have the potential to be applied for practical applications in phosphate management of waste and storm water.","5967":"Surface ligand dynamics of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) has been revealed as an important issue for determining QDs performance in their synthesis and postsynthesis treatment, such as ligand-related photoluminescence, colloidal stability, and so forth. However, this issue is less associated with the preparation of highly luminescent nanocomposites, which usually leads to poor performance and repeatability. In this work, on the basis of the studies about surface ligand dynamics of aqueous QDs, highly luminescent QDscellulose composites are prepared and employed to fabricate high color purity light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Detailed investigations indicate that the species of QD capping ligands and in particular the temperature are the key for controlling the ligand dynamics. The preparation of nanocomposites using less dynamic ligand-modified QDs at low temperature overcomes the conventional problems of QD aggregation, low QD content, luminescence quenching and shift, thus producing highly luminescent QDscellulose composites. This protocol is available for a variety of aqueous QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and CdSexTe1-x, which permits the design and fabrication of QD-based LEDs using the nanocomposites as color conversion layer on a blue emitting InGaN chip.","3927":"Fossil energy shortage will certainly force\/motivate human beings to develop renewable energy technologies to alleviate the burden on already strained energy resources and solve other detrimental socioeconomic issues. Fuel cells and metal-air batteries are presumed upon to be promising for future automotive applications. For this to happen, low-cost, earth-abundant electrocatalysts of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode are urgently desired to replace the precious noble metal (or noble metal-containing) ones to overcome the inherent sluggish kinetics of ORR. Sweet potato vines are harvested after the tubers are consumed and most of them have been ignored except for a limited use as an alternative supplement on feed intake of livestock and just released to the environment naturally or open incinerated even though they are typically rich in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (from threonine, lysine, and sulfur-containing amino acids). China is the leading producer of sweet potato and has an absolutely high proportion of the annual world's production. Herein, this work presents the cost-effective synthesis of carbon materials as highly durable ORR electrocatalyst, produced by carbonizing the wasted sweet potato vines. The absence of any activation, reasonable in-situ nitrogen and sulfur doping, porous graphitic structure along with a high surface area and excellent conductivity contribute to a superior electrocatalytic ORR activity, demonstrating a hopeful alternative for commercial Pt\/C catalyst in fuel cells in terms of electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and especially durability. Density functional theory calculations support this result. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the as-prepared heteroatoms-doped porous carbon material is as high as 265 F g(-1), with a superior cycling stability for electric double-layer supercapacitor at a current density of 1 A g(-1) after 10,000 cycles, suggesting that it has a promising potential for wide applications in the field of energy storage devices.

Due to their high flexibility, charged nature, periodicity, and polymeric nature, GAGs are challenging systems for computational approaches. To deal with the length challenge, coarse-grained (CG) modeling could be a promising approach. In this work, we develop AMBER-compatible CG parameters for GAGs using all-atomic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent and the Boltzmann conversion approach. We compare both global and local properties of GAGs obtained in the simulations with AA and CG approaches, and we conclude that our CG model is appropriate for the MD approach of long GAG molecules at long time scales.","3651":"N-(2-Oxotetrahydrothiophen-3-yl)acrylamide was successfully polymerized on the surface of amine functionalized magnetic silica nanocomposites via an ultrasound-assisted method.

In addition, the future challenge and the prospect of the development of nanomaterial optical sensors for Hg2+ detection were also discussed.","1928":"Textile fabric based electrodes due to their lightweight, flexibility and cost effectiveness, coupled with the ease of fabrication are recently given a huge attention as wearable energy sources. The current dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are based on Platinized-Fluorinated Tin oxide (Pt-FTO) glass electrode, which is not only expensive, but also rigid and heavyweight. In this work, a highly conductive-graphene coated cotton fabric (HC-GCF) is fabricated with a surface resistance of only 7 Omega sq(-1). HC-GCF is used as an efficient counter electrode (CE) in DSSC and the results are examined using photovoltaic and electrochemical analysis. HC-GCF counter electrode shows a negligible change of resistance to bending at various bending positions and is also found extremely resistant to electrolyte solution and washing with water. Cyclic voltammogram, Nyquist and the Tafel plots suggest an excellent electro catalytic activity (ECA) for the reduction of tri-iodide (I-3(-)) ions. Symmetrical cells prepared using HC-GCF, indicate a very low charge transfer resistance (R-CT) of only 1.2 Omega, which is nearly same to that of the Pt with 1.04 Omega.

Herein, we report a simple one-step annealing synthesis yielding a high surface area cellulose-derived activated carbon. We discover that simply varying the flow rate of Argon during pyrolysis enables 'self-activation' reactions that can tune the specific surface areas of the resulting carbon, ranging from 98 m(2)\/g to values as high as 2600 m2\/g. Furthermore, we, for the first time, observe a direct evolution of H-2 from the pyrolysis, which gives strong evidence towards an in situ self-activation mechanism. Surprisingly, the obtained activated carbon is a crumbled graphene nanostructure composed of interconnected sheets, making it ideal for use in an electrochemical capacitor. The cellulose-derived nanoporous carbon exhibits a capacitance of 132 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art activated carbons.

The removal of formaldehyde, a common indoor pollutant, has increasingly attracted widespread attention. In this work, we present two different methods for the production of electrospun PAN nanofibers containing beta CD capable of capturing formaldehyde from the air. The former comprised the addition of beta CD to PAN\/dimethyl sulfoxide solutions and the subsequent electrospinning of the mixture. The latter involved the crosslinking of beta CD on electrospun PAN fibers by alkaline hydrolysis and esterification with citric acid. For both methods, we used solutions with different polymer concentration and viscosity. In addition, the rheology of solutions, as well as the morphology, surface area, chemical structure and thermal resistance of electrospun fibers were analyzed. The formaldehyde capture potential of beta CD containing PAN nanofibers was evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography. Conclusively, we found that, while functionalized PAN nanofibers with average fiber diameter from 432 nm to 647 nm might be used for indoor air purification, functionalized fibers obtained by addition of beta CD are more effective for capturing formaldehyde than fibers obtained by crosslinking of beta CD.

The structural information and the coating characteristics of the nanoemulsion as well as its preservation properties on silvery pomfret were investigated. The results showed that the amount of CEOs added into a nanoemulsion reduced the stability and rheological properties of the nanoemulsion systems, which indirectly affected the physicochemical properties of the coatings. The formation of the nanoemulsion was attributed to interactions between the functional groups of chitosan and CEOs by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the preservation effects on silvery pomfret by the nanoemulsion coating were better than conventional emulsion coatings, which were ascribed to more efficient preventative microorganisms and lipid oxidation from silvery pomfret by the nanoemulsion coating. These results suggested that nanoemulsion coating containing CEOs have great potential in the seafood preservation field.","425":"Herein, we report on the synthesis, self-assembly, as well as the photophysical properties of a novel series of P-benzylated phosphole-lipids. In the context of this structure-property study we have systematically altered the number, position, and length of the alkyl chains in the 3-, 4-, and 5-position of the benzyl group. Both the self-assembly and photophysical properties of the compounds were found to correlate strongly with the alkyl chain length and chain arrangement of the mesogenic moiety.","2887":"Photobiological hydrogen production is of great importance because of its promise for generating clean renewable energy. In nature, green algae cannot produce hydrogen as a result of the extreme sensitivity of hydrogenase to oxygen. However, we find that silicification-induced green algae aggregates can achieve sustainable photobiological hydrogen production even under natural aerobic conditions. The core-shell structure of the green algae aggregates creates a balance between photosynthetic electron generation and hydrogenase activity, thus allowing the production of hydrogen. This finding provides a viable pathway for the solar-driven splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen to develop green energy alternatives by using rationally designed cell-material complexes.","712":"The acrylic fiber from Romania - Melana (PAN) consists in a tertiary copolymer obtained through copolymerization of three comonomers: vinyl-acetate (AV), acrylonitrile (AN) and Delta alpha-methyl styrene (MS). PAN functionalization depends on the reaction medium: a strongly basic pH converts the acetate group from AV in hydroxyl group, and the nitrile group from (AN) in COOH group via amide group. This thing does not happen in weakly acid medium realized with acetic acid (pH= 4-5). Yet, in this acid medium occurs the protonation of acrylic fiber, which confers the possibility of establishing electrovalent bonds between the fiber and a basic compound, such as chitosan. In this paper, one evaluates colorimetrically all the chemical modifications appeared on PAN during functionalization in basic\/acid medium and then grafting with chitosan (CS). Dyeing operations with non-specific dyes (reactive dyes) were performed using different concentrations, durations and pH. By comparing the tinctorial behaviour of the acrylic supports in the two mediums (add and basic), it resulted that functionalization through saponification determines important chemical modifications. Through grafting, the contribution of NH2 groups from CS makes possible dyeing in add medium, a fact confirmed by the values of colour strength (K\/S), as well as by the colour differences (Delta L*, Delta a*, Delta b*, Delta C*, Delta h*, Delta E*).The chemical modification produced during functionalization and grafting have been proved by qualitative methods (FTIR analyses and dropping colour test) and quantitative method (dyeing with reactive dyes when the values of K\/S and of colour differences can also highlight the impact of these modifications).","6723":"A series of cholinium cation-based bioionic liquids (BioILs) were synthetized with the aim of screening their performance as potential plasticizers of thermoplastic starch. To synthesize these BioILs, two easy and fast synthetic routes were selected: an ion exchange reaction, direct and economical, and a two-step acid-base reaction. Most of these BioILs allowed efficient plasticization of starch by film casting. The structure of the anion used significantly influences the thermo(hygro) mechanical and recrystallization behavior, making it possible to modulate the properties of the final material.","6018":"A novel route to fabricate low-cost porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using biomass tar, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and silver nanoparticles has been demonstrated through electrospinning and subsequent Stabilization and carbonization processes. The continuous electrospun nanofibers had average diameters ranging from 392 to 903 nm. The addition of biomass tar resulted In increased fiber diameters, reduced thermal stabilities, and slowed cyclization reactions of PAN in the as-spun nanofibers. After stabilization and carbonization, the resultant CNFs showed more uniformly sized and reduced average diameters (226-507 nm) compared to as-spun nanofibers. The CNFs exhibited high specific surface area (>400 m(2)\/g) and microporosity, attributed to the combined effects of phase separations of the tar and PAN and thermal decompositions of tar components. These pore characteristics increased the exposures and contacts of silver nanoparticles to the bacteria including Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli, leading to excellent antimicrobial performances of as-spun nanofibers and CNFs. A new strategy is thus provided for utilizing biomass tar as a low-cost precursor to prepare functional CNFs and reduce environmental pollutions associated with direct disposal of tar as an industrial waste.","4152":"The gelatin-glutaraldehyde (gelatin-GA) nanofibers were electrospun in order to overcome the defects of ex-situ crosslinking process such as complex process, destruction of fiber morphology and decrease of porosity. The morphological structure, porosity, thermal property, moisture absorption and moisture retention performance, hydrolytic resistance, mechanical property and biocompatibility of nanofiber scaffolds were tested and characterized. The gelatin-GA nanofiber has nice uniform diameter and more than 80% porosity. The hydrolytic resistance and mechanical property of the gelatin-GA nanofiber scaffolds are greatly improved compared with that of gelatin nanofibers. The contact angle, moisture absorption, hydrolysis resistance, thermal resistance and mechanical property of gelatin-GA nanofiber scaffolds could be adjustable by varying the gelatin solution concentration and GA content. The gelatin-GA nanofibers had excellent properties, which are expected to be an ideal scaffold for biomedical and tissue engineering applications.","3806":"BACKGROUND: Electro-Fenton technology has already demonstrated its ability to degrade organic pollutants. In this treatment hydroxyl radicals are formed due to the reaction of the iron catalyst along with in situ electrogenerated H2O2. However, one of the main limitations of this system is the iron released in the treated effluent. Therefore, retention of iron is required, and in this study, the use of a new cathode in which the iron is fixed on nickel foam is proposed as a solution to the electro-Fenton treatment in continuous processes. RESULTS: The retention of iron was ensured by its fixation on nickel foam using chitosan, an eco-friendly polymer, as coating agent. Different chitosan coatings were tested to optimize the manufacturing process of the new cathode. It was concluded that the best electrode for the electro-Fenton treatment of different dyes (Poly R-478 and Lissamine Green B) was obtained using a half-coating electrode cover with iron-chitosan of medium molecular weight. Furthermore, its reusability was positively evaluated in successive cycles. Finally, a continuous treatment using a fluidized bed reactor was successfully performed for the treatment of dye Lissamine Green B. CONCLUSION: Summarizing, this new cathode is a suitable alternative for the treatment of coloured wastewater by continuous electro-Fenton treatment.

DBF powders in both amorphous (orange) and crystalline (yellow and green) states undergo rapid reversible shifts in their maximum emission wavelengths (lambda(em)) during the freezing-thawing (F-T) process. When the acetonitrile\/water DBF dispersions emitting orange or yellow colours are F-T treated, their emissions change to green. Moreover, the DBF dispersions containing poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and acrylamide (AAm) undergo gradual and more significant blue-shift in lambda(em) with F-T cycles, and further blue-shifts in lambda(em) are found when F-T treated dispersions are gelated or just kept for some time. The emission change of the DBF dispersions with the F-T process and the after-treatment is confirmed to be due to the change of their aggregation morphologies. DBF dispersions and hydrogels with different emission colours are obtained, and the luminescent hydrogels exhibit excellent mechanical properties. This study reveals a new freezing-induced emission change of AIE substances and provides a simple method for preparing hydrogels emitting different colours by using one luminogen.","447":"The low energy density of commercially available activated carbon-based supercapacitors has limited their widespread applications. In the current work, we demonstrated fabrication of carbon nanofiber-based supercapacitors that exhibited ultra-high energy density by rationally tailoring their pore structure in an ionic liquid system. To gain control on the pore structure, three different methods were employed for the synthesis of an electrospinning-derived freestanding carbon nanofiber web. They are incorporation of a pore generator (i.e., tetraethyl orthosilicate) in the electrospinning step, physical activation (e.g., H2O or CO2), and hydrogen treatment. We observed finely tuned pore sizes ranging from 0.734 to 0.831 nm and accompanying changes in BET surface areas ranging from 1160 to 1624 m(2) g(-1). The entrapped TEOS within the electrospun organic nanofiber web provided high tuning ability of the pore structure in the following carbonization step, and decreased the activation energy of the pore formation. Both high specific capacitance (161 F g(-1)) and ultra-high energy density (246 W h kg(-1)) were achieved when the pore size on the surface of carbon nanofibers matched with the ionic size of the electrolyte. Our results demonstrate the importance of a finely tuned pore structure to secure high-temperature operable carbon nanofiber-based supercapacitors with ultrahigh energy density using ionic liquids as electrolytes.","3872":"A magnetic reduced graphene oxide composite (MRGO) was successfully prepared by a simple and green method. MRGO was then used as an adsorbent and found to exhibit enhanced removal efficiency for various chlorophenols (CPs) from water compared with its precursors, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide. The CPs were o-chlorophenol, p-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. Among them, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which exhibited the lowest water solubility and highest molecular weight, most easily bound to MRGO. The preferential interactions between MRGO and CPs were hydrophobic interactions (pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic effect). This result was confirmed by the equilibrium adsorption behavior in which isotherms were all well described by Freudlich model, indicating heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption. Therefore, CP adsorption was more favored under neutral and acidic conditions, and the decreased removal efficiency of MRGO at higher pH levels was due to the improved hydrophilicity of CPs for deprotonation effect. Moreover, MRGO showed fast removal of each CP, achieving adsorption equilibrium within 10.0 min, presented efficient separation from water under an external magnetic field, and was easily regenerated using dilute NaOH aqueous solution after reaching saturated adsorption. Adsorption capacity of the regenerated MRGO had almost no loss until after five cycles. In summary, MRGO was an efficient adsorbent for the removal of various CPs and had considerable application potential in water treatment.","3263":"[C\/Fe3O4]@C coaxial nanocables with electricity-magnetism-adsorption trifunctionality have been successfully synthesized by carbonization of the electrospun [polyacrylonitrile (PAN)\/ferric acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)(3))]@polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coaxial nanocables. SEM and TEM observations reveal that the products are coaxial nanocables in morphology. The core diameter is ca. 125 nm and the shell thickness is ca. 82 nm. Electrical and magnetic properties analyses show that the [C\/Fe3O4]@C coaxial nanocables possess tunable electrical conductivity and magnetic performance. The N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements demonstrate the specific surface area and the pore size of the [C\/Fe3O4]@C coaxial nanocables are 322.6 m(2)\/g and 33.6 nm, respectively. [C\/Fe3O4]@C coaxial nanocables exhibit efficient adsorption for Rhodamine B and Cu2+ ions aqueous solution with excellent magnetic separation performance. The isotherms and kinetics of adsorption process are determined and analyzed in detail. The excellent adsorption capacity can be attributed to the porous structures, which will make them to be promising adsorbents for water treatment. This work provides a new insight into the design and development of functional carbon-based nanomaterials.","5540":"Magnetic material grafted with acid polyionic liquids was successfully prepared by the radical oligomerization of bis-vinylimidazolium salts on the surface of mercaptopropyl-modified silica-coated Fe3O4, and well characterized by several model technologies. The as-prepared magnetic catalyst (Fe3O4@SiO2-SH-Im-HSO4) showed high catalytic activity for the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and fructose-based carbohydrates. The reaction temperature showed a remarkable effect on EMF yield. High EMF yield of 89.6% was obtained at 100 degrees C by the etherification of HMF. The one-pot conversion of fructose, sucrose and inulin catalyzed by Fe3O4@SiO2-SH-Im-HSO4 generated EMF with yields of 60.4%, 34.4% and 56.1%, respectively. The catalyst could be readily separated from the reaction mixture by a permanent magnet, and showed high stability in recycling experiments. This study shows a green and sustainable method for the synthesis of value-added liquid fuel from renewable resources.","592":"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets are attracting increased attention because of their excellent optical properties. Inspired by the natural exfoliation of seaside rocks, we propose a \"chemical weathering\" concept for fabricating h-BN nanosheets from their bulk counterparts. We experimentally demonstrate that chemical weathering-assisted exfoliation is a simple and efficient method for preparing h-BN nanosheets. These nanolayers have a high solubility in water because of the hydroxylation of h-BN (OH-BNNS). Interestingly, the as-prepared OH-BNNSs exhibit excellent optical limiting properties with fascinating two-photon absorption. It is a new and advanced optical material in the application of sensitive optical components, and shield human eyes from laser-induced damage.","6951":"Preparations of barium titanate microfibers made by electrospinning using a suspension of BaTiO3\/PVC resin solution are described in this paper.

The morphology and compositions at room temperature and the caused by effect of calcination on the fibrous membrane BaTiO3\/PVC composite were investigated by SEM and ZAF. Typical fiber diameter was obtained between 14m and 20m with fibers lengths exceeding 500m with nanoporous whose diameters were formed between 350nm and 700nm into the microfibers.","2389":"Li-O-2 batteries with super-high theoretical energy density are attracting extensive attention. However, the sluggish oxygen reduction\/ evolution reaction, the huge volume change from O-2\/Li2O2 conversion and the undesired electrolyte decomposition in cathode limit their performance. Herein we show design and synthesis of RuO2-coated ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays by using a natural crab shell template as a catalyst for Li-O-2 battery, exhibiting several advantage features. First, the ordered mesopores in nanofibers facilitate electrolyte penetration and electron\/ion transfer. In addition, the macrosized voids between the nanofibers provide efficient buffer space for O-2\/Li2O2 accommodation and improve O-2 diffusion. Furthermore, the uniform RuO2-coating layer alleviates undesired electrolyte decomposition and enhances the surface electronic conductivity. As a result, the battery displays high performance, including high capacity (20600 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1)), high rate (9750 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1)) and long-life (300 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1)).

In parallel with this has been the rapid rise of both sustainable materials and, as a consequence, Natural, Cellular and Responsive material systems. Many of these originate from inorganic, inorganic-organic hybrid composites and polymeric and bio-nano polymeric systems which exhibit intrinsic physico-chemical properties that can be classed as 'soft'. That is flexible, malleable, lightweight, transparent or semi-transparent and stretchable in character and which can also offer both biocompatible and bioresorbable characteristics essential to useable and sustainable material systems. This paper describes some of the ways in which we are beginning to understand, explain and exploit 'soft' technology. In particular the interactive role of creative design and innovative material science linked through new fabrication methodologies that have, as their common purpose, a focus on compelling Human centred needs. Examples are health, wellness, ambient assistance and urgent improvements in cleanliness, hygiene and nutrition.","2020":"Production and storage of energy in a highly efficient and environmentally sustainable way is a demand of the current century to meet the growing global energy requirement. Design and development of novel materials and processes that allow precise control over the electrochemical behavior and conductivity of electrolytes is necessary for acquiring such targets. Development of ionic liquid crystals with ordered domains endowed with enhanced ionic conductivity from renewable resources is receiving much interest in this respect. In this paper, we report a unique strategy for the preparation and utilization of ionic liquid crystalline electrolyte derived from a renewable resource: cashew nut shell liquid; an abundantly available waste byproduct from cashew industry. We have prepared imidazolium-based ionic liquid crystal (PMIMP) from cardanol and studied its structure and liquid crystalline phase formation by various techniques. The symmetrical supercapacitor fabricated with mesoporous carbon electrodes employing PMIMP as electrolyte measured a specific capacitance of 131.43 F\/g at a current density of 0.37 A\/g with excellent cycle stability and 80% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. All these excellent properties of the prepared ionic liquid crystalline electrolyte suggest its application as an efficient, environmentally friendly and low-cost electrolyte for energy storage devices.","131":"A long-length (hundred micrometers) carbon nanotube is successfully dispersed in aqueous solution with surfactant cellulose while maintaining its length. An electrochemical study of the synthetic pathway of dopamine (DA), dopamine-o-quinone (DAQ), leucodopaminechrome (LDAC), and dopaminechrome (DAC) at the electrode fabricated by the long-length carbon nanotube dispersed solution is presented. The sequence DA reversible arrow DAQ -> LDAC reversible arrow DAC for the reaction is electron transfer-chemical reaction-electron transfer (ECE)-type, which is a chemical reaction (DAQ -> LDAC, C) interposed between two electron transfer reactions (DA reversible arrow DAQ and LDAC reversible arrow DAC, E). The salient electrochemical signals due to both DA reversible arrow DAQ and LDAC reversible arrow DAC can be obtained at the long-length carbon nanotube electrode, unlike other carbon electrodes such as carbon paste, graphene, fullerene, nanofiber, and graphite. The overall reaction is dominated by step DAQ -> LDAC and is sensitive to pH. With cyclic voltammetry in acidic media, the peak current due to LDAC -> DAC disappeared at a higher scan rate because the reaction rate for DAQ -> LDAC was so slow that DAQ was completely consumed in the electron transfer of DAQ -> DA before the chemical reaction of DAQ -> LDAC could go forward. In alkaline media, the peak height due to DAC -> LDAC became as high as that due to DA -> DAQ because the DAQ -> LDAC rate became fast enough that a sufficient amount of LDAC was generated for the subsequent reaction of LDAC -> DAC. Concomitantly, the reaction DAQ + LDAC reversible arrow DA + DAC was generated. Quantitative and selective detection of dopamine based on the signal due to LDAC -> DAC is possible just as in the conventional strategy of direct oxidation of dopamine (DA -> DAQ).","1760":"Owing to its low cost and high natural abundance, sodium metal is among the most promising anode materials for energy storage technologies beyond lithium ion batteries. However, room-temperature sodium metal anodes suffer from poor reversibility during long-term plating and stripping, mainly due to formation of nonuniform solid electrolyte interphase as well as dendritic growth of sodium metal. Herein we report for the first time that a simple liquid electrolyte, sodium hexafluorophosphate in glymes (mono-, di-, and tetraglyme), can enable highly reversible and nondendritic plating-stripping of sodium metal anodes at room temperature. High average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.9% were achieved over 300 plating-stripping cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2). The long-term reversibility was found to arise from the formation of a uniform, inorganic solid electrolyte interphase made of sodium oxide and sodium fluoride, which is highly impermeable to electrolyte solvent and conducive to nondendritic growth. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrate a room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery using this class of electrolytes, paving the way for the development of next-generation, sodium-based energy storage technologies.","6966":"An oil-in-water emulsion was ultrasonically prepared in aqueous chitosan solutions containing different counterions. Tetradecane was used as the oil phase in order to mimic nonpolar substances used in food processes. Various acids were used to dissolve chitosan, and we found that conjugate bases of the acids used, which act as counterions to neutralize the positive charges of ammonium ions present in the chitosan backbone, played a significant role in controlling the size, size distribution, and stability of chitosan. encapsulated tedradecane emulsion droplets (microspheres). The counterion effect is also found to be strongly dependent upon tetradecane (TD)\/chitosan (CS) ratio and ultrasonic power. Key observations are: (i) for a given TD\/CS ratio, the size and size distribution decrease when the acid is varied from nitric acid to benzenesulfonic acid at high TD\/CS ratio, and the effect becomes less significant at low TD\/CS ratio; (ii) for a given acid, the size and size distribution increase with an increase in TD\/CS ratio; and (iii) at low TD\/CS ratio the size and size distribution are significantly influenced by the viscosity of the system. A possible mechanism for the observed counterion effect is proposed. The role of counterions, solution viscosity, and ultrasonic power in controlling the physical and functional properties of ultrasonically generated chitosan-stabilized tetradecane microspheres is discussed in detail. The key new finding of this study is that it is possible to form stable emulsions without the addition Of external emulsifiers and stabilizers, but only using chitosan with different acids to dissolve chitosan. This strategy could be used in the generation of stable food emulsions.","1372":"Crystalline ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) has the highest repotted thermal conductivity at room temperature: 104 W\/(m.K), while theoretical predictions proposed an even higher value of 300 W\/(m.K). Defects and amorphous fraction in practical UHMWPE fibers significantly reduces the thermal conductivity from the ideal value. Although the amorphous effect can be readily analyzed based on the effective medium theory, the defect effects are poorly understood. This work reports on the temperature-dependent behavior (down to 22 K) of thermal diffusivity and conductivity of UHMWPE fibers in anticipation of observing the reduction in phonon density and scattering rate against temperature and of freezing out high-momentum phonons to clearly observe the defect effects. By studying the temperature-dependent behavior of thermal reffusivity (Phi, inverse of thermal diffusivity) of UHMVVPE fibers, we are able to quantify the defect effects on thermal conductivity. After taking out the amorphous region's effect, the residual thermal reffusivities (Phi(0)) for the studied two samples at the 0 K limit are determined as 3.45 X 10(4) and 2.95 x 10(4) s\/m(2), respectively. For rare-\/no-defects crystalline materials, Phi(0) should be dose to zero at the 0 K limit. The defect-induced low-momentum phonon mean free paths are determined as 8.06 and 9.42 nm for the two samples. They are smaller than the crystallite size in the (002) direction (19.7 nm) determined by X-ray diffraction. This strongly demonstrates the diffuse phonon scattering at the grain boundaries. The grain boundary thermal conductance (G) can be evaluated as G approximate to beta pc(p)nu with sound accuracy. At room temperature, G is around 3.73 GW\/(m(2).K) for S2, comparable to that of interfaces with tight atomic bonding.","2977":"This research describes the utility of ethyl 2-amino-6,8-dimethyl-1,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrrolo-[1,2-a]pyrazine-7-carboxylate as a key starting material for synthesis of novel analogues of natural alkaloid peramine. This heterocyclic compound was synthesized by the reaction of corresponding N-alkylpyrrole with hydrazine hydrate in good yield. In further step, chemical reactivity of N-aminopiperazine was studied towards some electrophilic reagents such as carbonyl compounds, triethyl orthoformate, nitrous acid, acetylenedicarboxylic acid. The new compounds were characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, IR, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallographic study.","1452":"Hydrothermal carbonization is considered to be an environment-friendly method to pretreat biomass. Therefore, hydrothermal carbonization of the husks of nuts from Carya cathayensis Sarg,, at various temperatures and pHs were performed and the fuel properties of the obtained residue, water-soluble products (WSP) and acetone-soluble products (ASP) were characterized. It was found that the residue yield decreased with increasing hydrothermal carbonization temperature while the yield of total soluble products (WSP and ASP) was nearly the same. The residue and total soluble products yields had no large changes in the pH range of 4.0-10.0, but fewer residues and more total soluble products were obtained at pH 13.0. It was confirmed that hemicellulose was more reactive than cellulose and lignin during hydrothermal carbonization and that lignin could be effectively hydrolyzed\/decomposed at pH 13.0. The higher heating values (HHVs) of residues were in the ranges of 22.0 to 28.2 MJ kg(-1) at temperatures from 180 to 260 inverted perpendicular C and pH from 4.0 to 10.0. The HHVs of these residues could be comparable with those of some commercial coals, such as lignite. However, the HI-IVs of residues decreased when the pH reached to 13.0. The WSP and ASP showed lower HHVs compared with heavy fuel oils, which meant the HHVs of WSP and ASP should be increased before being applied as bio-fuels.","624":"Poly(phosphoester)s (PPEs) play an important role in nature. They structure and determine life in the form of deoxy- and ribonucleic acid (DNA and RNA), and, as pyrophosphates, they store up chemical energy in organisms. Polymer chemistry, however, is dominated by the nondegradable polyolefins and degradable poly(carboxylic ester)s (PCEs) that are produced on a large scale today. Recent studies have illustrated the potential of PPEs for future applications beyond flame retardancy, and provided a coherent vision to implement this classic biopolymer in modern applications that demand biocompatibility and degradability as well as the possibility to adjust the properties to individual needs.","3135":"The development of an effective treatment able to reduce the healing time of chronic wounds is a major health care need. In this regard, our research group has recently demonstrated the in vivo effectiveness of the topical administration of rhEGF-loaded lipid nanoparticles in healing-impaired db\/db mice. Herewe report the effectiveness of rhEGF-NLC (rhEGF loaded nanostructured lipid carriers) in a more relevant preclinical model of wound healing, the porcine full-thickness excisional wound model. The rhEGF-NLC showed a particle size of around 335 nm, negative surface charge (-27 mV) and a high encapsulation efficiency of 94%. rhEGF plasma levels were almost undetectable, suggesting that no systemic absorption occurred, which may minimise potential side effects and improve treatment safety. In vivo healing experiments carried out in large white pigs demonstrated that 20 mu g of rhEGF-NLC topically administered twice a week increased the wound closure and percentage of healed wounds by day 25, compared with the same number of intralesional administrations of 75 mu g free rhEGF and empty NLC. Moreover, rhEGF-NLC improved the wound healing quality expressed in terms of number of arranged microvasculature, fibroblast migration and proliferation, collagen deposition and evolution of the inflammatory response. Overall, these findings demonstrated that topically administered rhEGF-NLC may generate de novo intact skin after full thickness injury in a porcine model, thereby confirming their potential clinical application for the treatment of chronic wounds.

The P3BT could serve as a heterogeneous nucleating agent, inducing the crystallization of p-DTS(EBTTh2)(2) to form interconnected nanofibers throughout the whole film. Moreover, the phase separation sizes of the active layer increased after incorporation of P3BT, accompanied by the enhanced surface roughness of the films. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency of the devices increased from 3.4% to 5.0% as the P3BT content reached 10 wt %, due to the enhanced light absorption of the active layer, as well as the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobility.","1277":"The performance of organic solar cell is greatly determined by the nanoscale heterojunction morphology, and finding a practical method to achieve advantageous nanostructure remains a challenge. We demonstrate here that ordered bulk heterojunction (OBHJ) solar cell can be fabricated assisted by a simple, cost-effective nanoimprinting lithography method using patterned silk fibroin film mold at room temperature. The P3HT nanogratings were achieved by nanoimprinting lithography (NIL) process, and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was spin-coated on the top of P3HT nanogratings. The conducting capacity of P3HT nanograting film has little difference compared with the unimprinted film in the vertical direction, due to the same edge-on chain alignment. However, it can be found that the fabrication of OBHJ nanostructure using room temperature NIL technique with patterned silk fibroin mold is able to promote optical absorption, interfacial area, and bicontinuous pathway. Therefore, the ordered heterojunction morphology plays an important part in improving device performance due to efficient exciton diffusion, dissociation, and reducing charge recombination rate.","1820":"CONSPECTUS: In 1996, a snapshot of the field of synthesis was provided by many of its thought leaders in a Chemical Reviews thematic issue on \"Frontiers in Organic Synthesis\". This Accounts of Chemical Research thematic issue on \"Synthesis, Design, and Molecular Function\" is intended to provide further perspective now from well into the 21st century. Much has happened in the past few decades. The targets, methods, strategies, reagents, procedures, goals, funding, practices, and practitioners of synthesis have changed, some in dramatic ways as documented in impressive contributions to this issue. However, a constant for most synthesis studies continues to be the goal of achieving function with synthetic economy. -Whether in the form of new catalysts, reagents, therapeutic leads, diagnostics, drug delivery systems, imaging agents, sensors, materials, energy generation and storage systems, bioremediation strategies, or molecules that challenge old theories or test new ones, the function of a target has been and continues to be a major and compelling justification for its synthesis. While the targets of synthesis have historically been heavily represented by natural products, increasingly design, often inspired by natural structures, is providing a new source of target structures exhibiting new or natural functions and new or natural synthetic challenges. Complementing isolation and screening approaches to new target identification, design enables one to create targets de novo with an emphasis on sought-after function and synthetic innovation with step-economy. Design provides choice. It allows one to determine how close a synthesis will come to the ideal synthesis and how close a structure will come to the ideal function. In this Account, we address studies in our laboratory on function-oriented synthesis (FOS), a strategy to achieve function by design and with synthetic economy. By starting with function rather than structure, FOS places an initial emphasis on target design, thereby harnessing the power of chemists and computers to create new structures with desired functions that could be prepared in a simple, safe, economical, and green, if not ideal, fashion. Reported herein are examples of FOS associated with (a) molecular recognition, leading to the first designed phorbol-inspired protein ldnase C regulatory ligands, the first designed bryostatin analogs, the newest bryologs, and a new family of designed kinase inhibitors, (b) target modification, leading to highly simplified but functionally competent photonucleases-molecules that cleave DNA upon photoactivation, (c) drug delivery, leading to cell penetrating molecular transporters, molecules that ferry other attached or complexed molecules across biological barriers, and (d). new reactivity-regenerating reagents in the form of functional equivalents of butatrienes, reagents that allow for back-to-back three-component cycloaddition reactions, thus achieving structural complexity and value with step-economy. While retrosynthetic analysis seeks to identify the best way to make a target, retrofunction analysis seeks to identify the best targets to make. In essence, form (structure) follows function.","5021":"Developing advanced graphene-based composites is significant for the development of renewable green energy technology. Herein, we report a sandwich-like graphene-based composite (i.e., Fe-doped Ni2P nanoparticles encapsulated by a graphene-like envelope), which is synthesized by the first polymerization of glucose (as a green carbon source) on the Fe-doped NiNH4PO4 center dot H2O nanosheet surface followed by high temperature annealing. The annealing process will crystallize the coated polymer into multilayer graphene, as the same time the Fe-doped precursor is decomposed into Fe-doped Ni2P ((Fe) Ni2P) nanoparticles encapsulated by the graphene envelope ((Fe) Ni2P\/graphene). When evaluated as a water splitting catalyst in acidic solutions, the graphene-encapsulated Fe-doped Ni2P exhibits a low overpotential (similar to 50 mV) and a small Tafel slope (similar to 45 mV per decade) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. More importantly, the (Fe) Ni2P\/graphene composite shows an excellent stability in acid solutions in contrast to conventional Ni-based catalysts. On the other hand, owing to the structural advantage (i.e., efficient inner volume space for the nanoparticle expansion, high porosity for the electrolyte diffusion and high conductivity), the (Fe) Ni2P\/graphene nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacity of 642 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and excellent cycling stability (93% retained after 200 cycles).","6786":"Developing Pt replacement catalysts for the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for the application of energy conversion technology. Here, the N, O and S tri-heteroatom-doped, hierarchically porous carbon material was obtained by pyrolysis of natural China rose petals as a precursor, followed by chemical activation and post-treatment with melamine. The results demonstrated that the micro\/nano-structures of rose petals provide a hard template to form hierarchically porous structures, favorable for the mass transportation and electrolyte, while the saccharides in the rose petals were used as precursors for carbon. Moreover, the amino acids of rose petals and the additive melamine acted as the source of heteroatoms, thus creating enormous active sites for ORR. The as-prepared catalyst therefore displays an excellent electrocatalytic activity similar to the performance of Pt\/C in both alkaline and acid media, long term durability and better tolerance for methanol crossover\/CO poisoning effects than commercial Pt\/C, making it a promising alternative for platinum and other expensive metal-based catalysts toward ORR.","2399":"Hollow TiO2 nanofibers with embedded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared for use as photocatalysts through electrospinning, impregnation, and calcination using multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) with various ratios of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP), and further characterized by SEM, TGA, BET and XRD. The results demonstrated the successful fabrication of hollow TiO2 nanofibers with embedded CNTs. The CNT-embedded hollow TiO2 nanofibers prepared in this study exhibited improved photocatalytic activity compared to plain hollow TiO2 nanofibers based on the conversion of methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. The highest degradation ratio produced by the CNT-embedded hollow TiO2 nanofibers was approximately 62% after 70 min, which represented an increase of more than 80% over that of TiO2. It was found that the enhanced efficiency of MB removal could be attributed not only to the adsorption capability of the CNTs but also to electron transfer between the CNTs and the TiO2.

Herein, hybridized CNFs were produced from electrospinning the mixture solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and BG sol-gel precursors, followed by preoxidation and carbonization. Choosing 45S-type BG (mol%: 46.10% SiO2-41.48% CaO-12.42% P2O5) as the model, the interaction of BG precursors with PVP and the micro-structural evolution of CNF\/BG composites were systematically evaluated in relation to aging times (1-7 days) of BG precursor solution. With aging time prolonging, BG precursors underwent morphological changes from small sol clusters with a loosely and randomly branched structure at 1 day, to a fully developed Si-network structure at 3 days, and finally to a dense Si-network at 7 days. On one hand, it showed continuous increase in network linking degree. On the other hand, the gel particles underwent the process of size increase and subsequently decrease. This directly influenced the miscibility between BG precursors and PVP in solution, and the surface morphology of CNF\/BG composites. At short aging times, the sol-gel solution of BG precursors mixed uniformly with PVP and the resulting BG nanoparticles were less likely to migrate toward the fiber surface. With the aging time prolonging, the phase separation between BG precursors and PVP facilitated more BG nanoparticles to form on the fiber surface. Calcium ions were found to be able to interact with carbonyl groups in PVP, while phosphorus element would be lost gradually depending on aging time, which led the CaSiO3 formed in the final CNF\/BG changing from a weak to strong crystal state along with longer aging time. By soaking in simulated body fluid, it was found that the CNF\/BG composites prepared from BG precursor sol-gel solution with 7 day aging demonstrated the fastest apatite deposition, which was ascribed to those abundant BG nanoparticles on the fiber surface having exposed numerous nucleation sites for the apatite deposition. Promisingly, CNF\/BG composites developed from electrospinning and carbonization of PVP\/BG sol-gel mixtures were envisioned good choices for bone repairing.","7134":"We aimed to develop lecithin-based nanoemulsions intended for effective aceclofenac (ACF) skin delivery utilizing sucrose esters [sucrose palmitate (SP) and sucrose stearate (SS)] as additional stabilizers and penetration enhancers. To find the suitable surfactant mixtures and levels of process variables (homogenization pressure and number of cycles-high pressure homogenization manufacturing method) that result in drug-loaded nanoemulsions with minimal droplet size and narrow size distribution, a combined mixture-process experimental design was employed. Based on optimization data, selected nanoemulsions were evaluated regarding morphology, surface charge, drug-excipient interactions, physical stability, and in vivo skin performances (skin penetration and irritation potential). The predicted physicochemical properties and storage stability were proved satisfying for ACF-loaded nanoemulsions containing 2% of SP in the blend with 0%-1% of SS and 1%-2% of egg lecithin (produced at 50 degrees C\/20 cycles\/800 bar). Additionally, the in vivo tape stripping demonstrated superior ACF skin absorption from these nanoemulsions, particularly from those containing 2% of SP, 0.5% of SS, and 1.5% of egg lecithin, when comparing with the sample costabilized by conventional surfactant-polysorbate 80. In summary, the combined mixture-process experimental design was shown as a feasible tool for formulation development of multisurfactant-based nanosized delivery systems with potentially improved overall product performances.

The Pd nanocatalyst proved to be capable of mediating the four-electron oxidation of H2O to O-2, both chemically and photochemically. The Pd nanocatalyst is easy to prepare and shows high chemical stability, low leaching, and recyclability. Together with its promising catalytic activity, these features make the Pd nanocatalyst of potential interest for future sustainable solar-fuel production.","4563":"Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy is increasingly being used as a tool for the atomic-level characterization of surface sites. DNP surface-enhanced SSNMR spectroscopy of materials has, however, been limited to studying relatively receptive nuclei, and the particularly rare O-17 nuclide, which is of great interest for materials science, has not been utilized. We demonstrate that advanced O-17 SSNMR experiments can be performed on surface species at natural isotopic abundance using DNP. We use O-17 DNP surface enhanced 2D SSNMR to measure O-17{H-1} HETCOR spectra as well as dipolar oscillations on a series of thermally treated mesoporous silica nanoparticle samples having different pore diameters. These experiments allow for a nonintrusive unambiguous characterization of hydrogen bonding and dynamics at the surface of the material; no other single experiment can give such details about the interactions at the surface. Our data show that, upon drying, strongly hydrogen-bonded surface silanols, whose motions are greatly restricted by the interaction when compared to lone silanols, are selectively dehydroxylated.","2540":"Despite many developed methods, it still remains a challenge to provide a simple and general strategy for the controlled preparation of chiral nanostructures. Here we report a facile and universal approach for the high-yield and scalable preparation of chiral nanofibers based on the self-assembly of various ultrathin one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanomaterials in vigorously stirred polymeric solutions. The obtained chiral nanofibers can be further transformed to same-handed chiral nanorings. As a proof-of-concept application, chiral MoS2 and multiwalled carbon nanotube nanofibers were used as promising active layers for flexible nonvolatile data storage devices. Impressively, the chiral MoS2 nanofiber-based memory device presents a typical nonvolatile flash memory effect with excellent reproducibility and good stability. Our method offers a general route for the preparation of various functional chiral nanostructures that might have wide applications.","93":"CoS and NiS nanomaterials anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, synthesized via combination of hydrothermal with sulfidation process, are studied as high-capacity anode materials for the reversible lithium storage. The obtained CoS nanofibers and NiS nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on rGO sheets without aggregation, forming the sheet-on-sheet composite structure. Such nanoarchitecture can not only facilitate ion\/electron transport along the interfaces, but also effectively prevent metal-sulfide nanomaterials aggregation during the lithium reactions. Both the rGO-supported CoS nanofibers (NFs) and NiS nanoparticles (NPs) show superior lithium storage performance. In particular, the CoS NFs-rGO electrodes deliver the discharge capacity as high as 939 mA h g(-1) after the 100th cycle at 100 mA g(-1) with Coulombic efficiency above 98%. This strategy for construction of such composite structure can also synthesize other metal-sulfide-rGO nanomaterials for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries.","2952":"The separation of the countercurrent hollow fiber membrane module has been characterized adapting a \"Multi-component Progressive Cell Balance\" approach and incorporated within the Aspen HYSYS process simulator. The simulated data is found to exhibit good accordance with published experimental result. The study of the double staged membrane module with permeate recycle system, which was proposed to be the optimum configuration in previous works, has been extended by altering the recycle ratio of the permeate stream to study the process economics. Parameter sensitivities of typical membrane selectivity and CO2 feed concentration adapted in industrial application have been conducted. The study of high CO2 content is highlighted since it represents the future expansion of natural gas extraction considering that most of the remaining fields contain high concentration. It is observed that the recycle ratio is an important parameter to be considered in the industrial design process since it affects the gas processing cost significantly. Increasing the recycle ratio is proposed to increase the membrane area and compressor power while improving the hydrocarbon recovery, with substantial impact observed at low selectivity membrane and high CO2 feed concentration. A tradeoff must be determined among these parameters for determination of the optimal recycle ratio configuration. (C) 2014 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

While many of its properties are understood in a bulk solvent, its behavior in a small hydrophobic nanopore still raises fundamental questions. For instance, a wetting\/dewetting transition in a hydrophobic solid-state or a polymer nanopore occurs stochastically and can only be prevented by external physical stimuli. Controlling these transitions would be a primary requirement to improve many applications. Some biological channels, such as gramicidin A (gA) proteins, show a high rate of water and ion diffusion in their central subnanochannel while their external surface is highly hydrophobic. The diameter of this channel is significantly smaller than the inner size of the lowest artificial nanopore in which water drying occurs (i.e. 1.4 nm). In this paper, we propose an innovative idea to generate nanopore wetting as a result of which the application of an external field is no longer required. In a nanopore, the drying or wetting of the inner walls occurs randomly (in experiments and in simulations). However, we have shown how the confinement of gA, in a dried hydrophobic nanopore, rapidly generates a stable wetting of the latter. We believe that this simple idea, based on biomimetism, could represent a real breakthrough that could help to improve and develop new nanoscale applications.","3574":"Acid gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are important and highly undesirable contaminants in natural gas, and membrane-based removal of these contaminants is environmentally attractive. Although removal of CO2 from natural gas using membranes is well established in industry, there is limited research on H2S removal, mainly due to its toxic nature. In actual field operations, wellhead pressures can exceed 50 bar with H2S concentrations up to 20%. Membrane plasticization and competitive mixed-gas sorption, which can both lead to a loss of separation efficiency, are likely to occur under these aggressive feed conditions, and this is almost always accompanied by a significant decrease in membrane selectivity. In this paper, permeation and separation properties of a hydroxyl-functionalized polymer with intrinsic microporosity (PIM-6FDA-OH) are reported for mixed-gas feeds containing CO2, H2S or the combined pair with CH4. The pure-gas permeation results show no H2S-induced plasticization of the PIM-6FDA-OH film in a pure H2S feed at 35 degrees C up to 4.5 bar, and revealed only a slight plasticization up to 8 bar of pure H2S. The hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane exhibited a significant pure-gas CO2 plasticization resistance up to 28 bar feed pressure. Mixed-gas (15% H2S\/15% CO2\/70% CH4) permeation results showed that the hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane maintained excellent separation performance even under exceedingly challenging feed conditions. The CO2 and H2S permeability isotherms indicated minimal CO2-induced plasticization; however, H2S-induced plasticization effects were evident at the highest mixed gas feed pressure of 48 bar. Under this extremely aggressive mixed gas feed, the binary CO2\/CH4 and H2S\/CH4 permselectivities, and the combined CO2 and H2S acid gas selectivity were 25, 30 and 55, respectively. Our results indicate that OH-functionalized PIM materials are very promising candidate membrane materials for simultaneous removal of CO2 and H2S from aggressive natural gas feeds, which makes membrane-based gas separation technology an attractive option for clean energy production and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","4861":"Covalently tethered CO2 adsorbents are synthesized by acid catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of aziridine on the basal planes of three-dimensional hydroxylated graphene (HG). The resulting materials possess high surface areas, strong covalent bonds between polyethyleneimine (PEI) and graphene, and high thermal conductivity. The HG-PEI nanocomposites exhibit high amine loading (more than 10.03 mmol N g(-1)), high adsorption capacity (up to 4.13 mmol CO2 g(-1) in simulated ambient air under 1 atm of dry CO2) as well as good stability both at low (100 degrees C) and high desorption temperatures (135 degrees C), which allows the overall CO2 capture process to be promising and sustainable.","6127":"Two new glassy carbon modified electrodes were prepared by drop casting of chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or graphene oxide (GO) on glassy carbon (GC) and then protected with a polymeric layer of Nafion or chitosan (Chit) (GC\/Chit\/rGO\/Chit and GC\/GO\/Nafion). Their investigation by cyclic- and square-wave voltammetry for dopamine (DA) oxidation was aiming to estimate the analytical parameters that have the best values for GC\/Chit\/rGO\/Chit electrode (i.e., the highest sensitivity of 1.002 +\/- 0.025 mu A\/mu M, a detection limit of 2.67 mu M mu M, for a linear domain from 4 to 18 mu M DA). The modified GC\/Chit\/rGO\/Chit electrode was also used for the detection of dopamine in injection vials using the standard addition method with a recovery of 99.42%.","4313":"In the field of nanotechnology, polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have attracted both academic and industrial interest due to their exceptional electrical, mechanical and permeability properties. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art progress on the use of platelet-shaped fillers for the gas barrier properties of PNCs. Layered silicate nanoclays (such as montmorillonite and kaolinite) appear to be the most promising nanoscale fillers. These exfoliated nanofillers are able to form individual platelets when dispersed in a polymer matrix. The nanoplatelets do not allow diffusion of small gases through them and are able to produce a tortuous path which works as a barrier structure for gases. The utilization of clays in the fabrication of PNCs with different polymer matrices is explored. Most synthesis methods of clay-based PNCs are covered, including, solution blending, melt intercalation, in situ polymerization and latex compounding. The structure, preparation and gas barrier properties of PNCs are discussed in general along with detailed examples drawn from the scientific literature. Furthermore, details of mathematical modeling approaches\/methods of gas barrier properties of PNCs are also presented and discussed.","3169":"Engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs) without affecting biological functions remains a challenge, limiting the broad applications of EVs in biomedicine. Here, we report a method to equip EVs with various functional agents, including fluorophores, drugs, lipids, and bio-orthogonal chemicals, in an efficient and controlled manner by engineering parental cells with membrane fusogenic liposomes, while keeping the EVs intact. As a demonstration of how this method can be applied, we prepared EVs containing azide-lipids, and conjugated them with targeting peptides using copper-free click chemistry to enhance targeting efficacy to cancer cells. We believe that this liposome-based cellular engineering method will find utility in studying the biological roles of EVs and delivering therapeutic agents through their innate pathway.","6361":"In the last period, in the electronics, optoelectronics and other industries, more and more materials based on biopolymers have been developed, especially using DNA as matrix. One of the problems often encountered is related to the hydrophilicity of the material. In this paper are presented results on the hydrophilic\/hydrophobic character of thin films based on biomaterials (DNA, DNA-CTMA, Collagen) functionalized with various chromophores. This study is particularly important for applications in the electronics\/photonics, where the properties of these materials may be influenced by the amount of adsorbed\/absorbed water.","5330":"Energy is a key issue for future generation. Researches are conducted worldwide to develop new efficient means for energy conversion and storage. Electrochemical storage is foreseen as an efficient way to handle intermittent renewable energy production. The most advanced batteries are nowadays based on lithium-ion technology though their specific capacities should be significantly increased to bring solution to mass storage. Conversion reactions are one way to step forward larger capacities at the anode. We here review the possibility to use metallic or complex hydrides as negative electrode using conversion reaction of hydride with lithium. Moreover, promising alloying of lithium with the metallic species might provide additional reversible capacities. Both binary and ternary systems are reviewed and results are compared in the frame of the electrochemical application.","5331":"In this paper, the rheology and deposition behaviors of electrohydrodynamic direct-write (EDW) jet under stretching tension are studied. The EDW jet is stretched into tightened state by the drag force from moving collector, when moving speed of collector is higher than deposition velocity of jet. The drag force from the moving collector provides an extra force to stretch the charged jet, which promotes the stability and decreases the diameter of direct-written fiber. The whipping and bending motion of jet can be overcome by the drag force, and then, straight orderly fibers are direct-written along the trajectory of collector. The falling jet would be also deviated from the extension line of spinneret by the drag force. As the collector velocity increases from 10 to 1000 mm\/s, the average line width of direct-written microfiber decreases from 18.89 to 0.89 mu m. The thickness of microfiber ranges from 100 nm to 1.5 mu m. The moving collector leads to large deviation of charged jet. The tightened charged jet has good resistance against the interference of charge repulsion force, which helps to direct-write orderly nanofiber. During the EDW process, the mechanical stretching force had provided an excellent function to control the morphology and deposition pattern of micro-\/nanofiber.","764":"Surface modification of the magnetic cellulose particles has been conducted by using AEAPS, the modified magnetic cellulose particles were then used for the immobilization of lipase for catalysis reaction. The highest specific activity for AEAPS modified magnetic cellulose scaffold was increased to about 30 fold that of the free lipase without support. Furthermore, the reusability of the immobilized lipase on AEAPS modified magnetic cellulose particles was also improved, the relative activity of the ARCM-2 and AMRCM1-2 after being reused for 5 times still remained 72.8% and 71.2%, respectively. Moreover, the immobilized lipase on AEAPS modified magnetic cellulose particles was easily recovered without significant decrease in the specific activity. The immobilization of lipase on AEAPS modified magnetic cellulose particles led to the improvement in stability of activity and reusability for non-aqueous transesterification.","4051":"In this work, a novel Si\/nitrogen-rich porous C composite was prepared by the simple co-assembly of gelatin, nano-CaCO3 particles and Si nanoparticles, followed by a pyrolysis process and a subsequent acid washing treatment to remove the template. The Si nanoparticles adhered to the nitrogen-rich porous carbon framework, which possesses good conductivity and adequate free space to accommodate the volume change of Si nanoparticles during cycling. In contrast with the bare Si nanoparticles and the conventional Si\/C composite, the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Si\/nitrogen-rich porous C composite has been improved significantly. It delivers a reversible capacity of 1103 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 766 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1), much higher than those of commercial graphite anodes. In addition, the synthesis method can be easily scaled up and widely applied to other high-capacity anode and cathode material systems that undergo large volume expansion.","476":"Self-assembly of a 1,2-diol appended naphthalene diimide derivative featuring chiral and J-type aggregation is reported.

A theoretical model of the cooperative hydrogen bonding was also proposed.","1024":"It was proved in two independent experimental studies with the same group of 11 young sportsmen that creatine (CR) given as food supplement interfered with the metabolism of one- and two-carbon units. CR, given in one dose of 5 g daily during one month, induced reciprocal changes of muscle mass and body fat. These changes were characteristic of each of the four proband groups, into which the probands were divided on basis of the increased or decreased level of CR in urine, and the increased or decreased levels of folates and vitamin B-12 in blood. The comparison of results of short- and long-term CR supplementations showed that individual deviations found within the rank of each group are characteristic for each person under study. The changes of the level of thiodiglycolic acid in urine proved to be good markers for deviations from homeostasis.","6920":"In this paper, the ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays (MCNAs), Nickel-Boron (Ni-B) amorphous alloys, and amorphous Ni-B\/MCNAs composite for supercapacitor material have been successfully fabricated by a combination of templating method and chemical reduction process. The porous structure and large specific surface area (1270 m(2) g(-1)) of MCNAs favor the utilization of the active material Ni-B amorphous alloys and interfacial charge transport, and provide short diffusion paths for ions. X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, inductively coupled plasma. Transmission electron micrographs and selected area electronic diffraction were taken to characterize the structure of the ordered MCNAs, Ni-B amorphous alloy, and amorphous Ni-B\/MCNAs. Electrochemical properties are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge\/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the amorphous Ni-B\/MCNAs display superior capacitive performance (733 F g(-1)) over Ni-B amorphous alloys (562 F g(-1)) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and a good cycling stability after 1000 cycles.","4528":"Nanoscale photodetectors are highly attractive for their potential applications in integrated optoelectronic devices. One-dimensional flexible nanowire-based photodetectors are especially important because low-dimensional nanostructures are fascinating platforms for manipulating electrons and photons at the subwavelength scale. Herein, we report an ultraviolet visible photodetector based on a single crossed heterojunction assembled with quantum-dot-embedded polyaniline nanowires. The quantum-dot-embedded polyaniline nanowires are fabricated by a direct drawing method. Based on these inorganic organic hybrid nanowires, room-temperature, high-performance, high-speed photodetectors are constructed. The fabricated photodetectors show an excellent light response in the wavelength region of 365 to 550 nm, with an external quantum efficiency of 10(5) %, a responsivity of 10(3) A\/W, an on off switching ratio of 10, and a short response\/recovery time of 9 ms. These excellent performance characteristics are attributed to the abundant inorganic organic interfaces and the intermediate radiative reabsorption process. The spectral response range can be readily tuned to a desired waveband by changing the emission wavelength of the quantum dots. This cross-heterojunction-based photodetector may have potential applications in integrated photonic and optoelectronic devices.","4864":"A high performance gas barrier film was fabricated via alternate spin-coating of chitosan (CTS) and hierarchical layered double hydroxide (H-LDH). The H-LDH synthesized by a calcination-rehydration method shows a hierarchical structure with nanowalls aligned vertically on the LDH platelets, which were subsequently assembled in the CTS matrix, generating a hybrid film with excellent gas barrier properties. Compared with the (P-LDH\/CTS)(10) barrier film based on plate-like LDH (P-LDH), the (H-LDH\/CTS)(10) film exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen barrier properties with an oxygen transmission rate (OTR) below the detection limit of commercial instruments (<0.005 cm(3) m(-2) day(-1) atm(-1)). The greatly improved performance of the (H-LDH\/CTS)(10) film is attributed to the tortuous diffusion path in hierarchical architecture space. Moreover, experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal the existence of the adhesive force between oxygen and H-LDH (adsorption energy = -2.46 eV), which further reduces the oxygen diffusion rate and thus promotes oxygen barrier properties. Therefore, this work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy to fabricate high gas barrier materials, which can serve as a promising candidate for food\/pharmaceutical packaging and encapsulation of electronic devices.","2227":"The thermal fluctuations of lipid bi-layer membranes are key to their interaction with cellular components as well as the measurement of their mechanical properties. Typically, membrane fluctuations are analyzed by decomposing into normal modes or by molecular simulations. Here we propose two new approaches to calculate the partition function of a membrane. In the first approach we view the membrane as a fluctuating von Karman plate and discretize it into triangular elements. We express its energy as a function of nodal displacements, and then compute the partition function and co-variance matrix using Gaussian integrals. We recover well-known results for the dependence of the projected area of the membrane on the applied tension and recent simulation results on the dependence of membrane free energy on geometry, spontaneous curvature and tension. As new applications we compute the fluctuations of the membrane of a malaria infected cell and analyze the effects of boundary conditions on fluctuations. Our second approach is based on the cell model of Lennard-Jones and Devonshire. This model, which was developed for liquids, assumes that each molecule fluctuates within a cell on which a potential is imposed by all the surrounding molecules. We adapt the cell model to a lipid membrane by recognizing that it is a 2D liquid with the ability to deform out of plane whose energetic penalty must be factored into the partition function of a cell. We show, once again, that some results on membrane fluctuations can be recovered using this new cell model. However, unlike some well established results, our cell model gives an entropy that scales with the number of molecules in a membrane. Our model makes predictions about the heat capacity of the membrane that can be tested in experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cellular uptake in A549 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Silencing of target proteins was determined by Luciferase and MTT assays. Sub-G1 analysis was performed to evaluate apoptosis following co-delivery of siPLK1 and Doxorubicin (Dox). Zeta potential and siRNA complexation profile obtained for all hybrids were comparable to those achieved with cationic liposomes. ox-MWNTs-NH3 (+) showed greater extent of interaction with cationic liposomes compared to MWNTs-NH3 (+). ox-MWNTs-NH3 (+) was able to protect siRNA from nuclease-mediated degradation. Enhanced cellular uptake of both the carrier and loaded siRNA in A549 cell, were observed for this hybrid compared to the liposomal carrier. A synergistic pro-apoptotic effect was obtained when siPLK1 silencing was combined with doxorubicin treatment for the hybrid:siRNA complexes compared to the lipoplexes, in A549 cells in vitro. f-MWNTs-cationic liposome hybrid designed in this study can serve as a potential vehicle for the co-delivery of siRNA and cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells in vitro.","3396":"Composite fiber mats of a fluorinated acrylic copolymer and hydrophobic fumed silicon dioxide nanoparticles were produced through electrospinning process from a single solution. Morphological and chemical analysis of the fibers revealed that the nanoparticles were well-dispersed throughout the polymer matrix. Nanofiber mats showed much higher hydrophobicity and oleophobicity than sprayed surfaces of the same material, with contact angles above 150 degrees for water as well as lower surface tension organic liquids and oils. Moreover, layers of fibers were observed to peel away with rolling droplets while preserving the morphology of the underlying layers. Based on the dynamics of rolling droplets on the nanofiber mats as they were being encapsulated, a simple model to estimate the force needed to peel away fibers was created. This \"peel-away\" surface can offer a new approach to the preservation of omniphobicity upon wear damage.","4013":"Aldehyde hydrates are important but highly unstable, transient intermediates in biological and synthetic oxidations to carboxylic acids. We here report N-oxides as the first class of chemical reagents capable of stabilizing such water adducts. This stabilizing effect (studied in solution and in the solid state) seems to be based on the formation of hydrogen bonds.","2908":"Lead oxide nanowires are an attractive alternative to conventional pasted electrodes, owing to their high surface area leading to high specific energy batteries. Here, we report the performance of template electrodeposited PbO2 nanowires used as positive electrodes. Nanostructured electrodes were tested at constant charge\/discharge rate from 2 C to 10 C, with a cut-off potential of 1.2 V and discharge depth up to 90% of the gravimetric charge. These new type of electrodes are able to work at very high C-rate without fading, reaching an efficiency of about 90% with a very good cycling stability. In particular, after an initial stabilization, a specific capacity of about 200 mAh g(-1), very close to the theoretical one of 224 mAh g, was drained for more than 1000 cycles at a C-rate higher than 1 C with an efficiency close to 90%. This behaviour significantly distinguishes PbO2 nanostructured electrodes from the conventional ones with pasted active material. In addition, discharge at a quasi-constant voltage of about 2.1 V, without reaching the cut-off potential also at high C-rate, occurs. This implies a quasi-constant energy supply during fast discharge. According to these findings, innovative applications as hybrid or electrical mobility or buffer in renewable energy plants can be envisaged. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When these materials are used as anodes for lithium ion batteries, we observe improved percentage reversible capacity and cycle stability compared to those without ion-beam treatment. Furthermore, all ion-beam treated 3D graphene samples exhibit substantially higher Coulombic efficiencies, suggesting at beneficial role of vacancy-type defects in stabilizing solid-electrolyte interphases. Although 3D graphene exhibits initial reversible capacities that are 2-3 times higher than that of graphite (similar to 372 mAh\/g), fast capacity fading is observed but becomes more stable after ion-beam treatment. Our experimental results demonstrate that ionbeam treatment is an effective route to tune and produce good-performance graphene electrodes, and that vacancy-type defects help to promote reversible lithium storage capacity in graphene. We further observe that 3D GAs irradiated to the highest dose studied (1016 cm(-2)) fail rapidly upon electrochemical cycling, likely caused by the excessive ion-beam damage and graphene restacking. Raman I(D)\/I(D') signature is considered linked to defect type in graphene and thus is proposed, for the first time, as an indicator of the reversible capacity for GAs, (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

NPs designed to interact strongly with denatured lysozyme and relatively weakly with native lysozyme, facilitated resolubilization and refolding of aggregated lysozyme. Such NPs could be prepared by copolymerizing optimized combinations and populations of functional monomers. The refolded lysozyme showed native conformation and enzymatic activity. Eleven grams of aggregated protein was refolded by 1 g of NPs. However, NPs having low affinity to denatured lysozyme and NPs having high affinity to both denatured and native lysozyme showed relatively low facilitation activity. Our results suggest a potential strategy for the design of artificial chaperones with high facilitating activity.","2903":"Aerogels are synthetic porous materials derived from sol-gel materials in which the liquid component has been replaced with gas to leave intact solid nanostructures without pore collapse. Recently, aerogels based on natural or synthetic polymers, called polymer or organic aerogels, have been widely explored due to their porous structures and unique properties, such as high specific surface area, low density, low thermal conductivity and dielectric constant. This paper gives a comprehensive review about the most recent progresses in preparation, structures and properties of polymer and their derived carbon-based aerogels, as well as their potential applications in various fields including energy storage, adsorption, thermal insulation and flame retardancy. To facilitate further research and development, the technical challenges are discussed, and several future research directions are also suggested in this review.","752":"Recent reports on the paradoxical behaviour of epithelial cells in response to the varying stiffness of a polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) substrate has made 'matrix stiffness dependent cellular mechanotransduction' an open issue for further investigation. In this context, we have tried to address the fundamental question, \"Are human keratinocytes sensitive towards PDMS substrate stiffness?\". To decipher the underlying relationship between PDMS substrate stiffness and keratinocyte mechanotransduction, we modulated the stiffness of the PDMS substrate across a physiological range (elastic modulus ranging from 1.6 MPa to 0.05 MPa) and characterized the behaviour of human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Preliminary analysis of the topographical features (contact angle, protein adsorption and distribution, and surface roughness) and mechanical properties (elastic modulus, stress relaxation time and ductility) ensured that all the PDMS substrates were topographically similar but differed in their mechanical properties. Matrix stiffness dependent variation in the cellular response was contoured, qualitatively and quantitatively, by mapping the cytoskeletal organization (FESEM and immunocytochemistry) and studying cell proliferation (live cell population assay, MTT assay in the presence and absence of mechanotransduction pathway blockers and flow cytometry analysis of proliferative cell population). The result showed that there was a significant increase in cell proliferation with increasing matrix stiffness whereas cell spreading was affected differentially. Mechanistic analysis revealed that stiffness induced cell proliferation was beta-catenin independent but ERK1\/2 dependent. Analysis at the nuclear level, showed that the soft surface caused nuclear mechanotransduction (evident from nuclear lamin A\/C expression) and perturbed the transcription pattern of protein (VEGF as model protein) in HaCaT cells. This study confirmed that the human keratinocytes are mechanosensitive towards the stiffness of a PDMS substrate.","1954":"The desalination performance of capacitive deionization (CDI) technology is governed by electrode material properties, such as specific surface area, pore size and structure, surface functional groups, electrode geometry, and electrical conductivity. However, few studies have been conducted regarding the impact of the electrical conductivity of electrode materials on the desalination performance of CDI. In this study, monolithic composite web electrodes are fabricated. These electrodes are composed of reduced graphene oxide\/activated carbon nanofiber with tuned conductivity by using an ultrasound-assisted electrospinning method. Freestanding monolithic carbon nanofiber webs function as a framework that prevents graphene sheets from restacking. The conductive graphene network helps quickly transfer electrons across the matrix while the ions are efficiently stored in the pores of the electrodes; as a result, a high electrosorption capacity for NaCl of 9.2 mg\/g is achieved. The electrical conductivity of the electrodes is correlated with the ion removal efficiency of desalination. Results show that the electrosorption capacity of desalination governed by the electric double-layer scheme can be improved by increasing the electrical conductivity of the electrodes. These findings may provide new insights into the design and fabrication of novel porous electrode materials and elucidate the importance and effects of electrode conductivity on CDI.

Application of these materials as thermoresponsive and antibacterial wound dressings with proper mechanical properties, efficient handling of wound exudates and easy peeling from the wounded area were examined. The thermoresponsivity of the membranes was elucidated via differential scanning calorimetry and measuring water absorption at different temperatures. Ease of removal of the designed dressings from the wound bed was confirmed based on qualitative examination of adhered cells to the dressings at temperatures lower and higher than the lower critical solution temperature of the prepared membranes. The proper bulk hydrophilicity and water vapour transmission rate of designed dressings showed their ability for managing of wound exudates. The potential ability of prepared dressings for protection of the wound bed from external forces over the entire period of healing was confirmed by their excellent tensile properties even at a fully hydrated state. In situ generation and dispersion of AgNPs into the matrix of the dressings, as well as the size of these particles were elucidated by EDX and TEM methods. An MTT assay against human dermal fibroblast cells performed on dressings with and without AgNPs approved their appropriate cytocompatibility. And finally, the measured antimicrobial activity of the dressings against different Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as a fungal strain showed promising efficiency of impregnated AgNPs for combating microorganisms.","2932":"We report on a simple and practical method for creation of transparent and electrically conductive films by using ultra-long single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as the functioning elements. The ultra-long SWCNTs were ultimately dispersed into tubular levels for dispersion (denoted as mono-dispersion) in aqueous solutions by using glycocholate mixed with cholate as the dispersant. The resulting colloids were cast uniformly over the surface of flexible polyethylene terephthalate film through a wire-bar coating process. After washing by diluted nitric acid, the dispersants have been largely eliminated while the carbon nanotubes have been firmly retained on the surface of the film. These carbon nanotubes were finally transferred and permanently immobilized onto the surface of another piece of film with cellulose as the binder. Serial film samples each having different densities of the carbon nanotubes on the surface were prepared for studying the conductive mechanism. Film samples having densities around 30-tubes per mu m(2) were found to be capable of creating continuously interconnected carbon nanotube networks with a 92% transparency and a 286 Omega\/sq resistivity through the formation of approximately 160 tube-to-tube junctions per mu m(2). These highly conductive and transparent films transfer electrons by the carbon nanotube networks with a slightly deformed tube-to-tube junction feature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conversion and storage of solar energy via a renewable method, such as photocatalysis, holds great promise as such an alternative. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have gained attention in solar energy conversion because they have a long axis to absorb incident sunlight yet a short radial distance for separation of photogenerated charge carriers. In particular, well-ordered spatially high dimensional architectures based on 1D nanostructures with well-defined facets or anisotropic shapes offer an exciting opportunity for bridging the gap between 1D nanostructures and the micro and macro world, providing a platform for integration of nanostructures on a larger and more manageable scale into high-performance solar energy conversion applications. In this review, we focus on the progress of photocatalytic solar energy conversion over controlled one-dimension-based spatially ordered architecture hybrids. Assembly and classification of these novel architectures are summarized, and we discuss the opportunity and future direction of integration of 1D materials into high-dimensional, spatially organized architectures, with a perspective toward improved collective performance in various artificial photoredox applications.","351":"A novel composite matrix polymethacrylic acid-grafted Chitosan\/Bentonite (PMAA-g-CS\/B) was prepared through graft copolymerization reaction of methacrylic acid and chitosan in the presence of bentonite and N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide as cross linker. The composite was well characterized using FTIR, XPS, SEM, TG\/DTG, surface area analyzer and potentiometric titrations. The adsorption behavior of the composite towards Pb(II) from water and simulated battery manufacturing wastewater was studied under varying operating conditions. The kinetics of adsorption as well as adsorption isotherms at different temperatures was studied. Adsorption-desorption experiments over four cycles illustrate the feasibility of the repeated uses of this composite for the extraction of Pb(II) from aqueous solutions.","487":"The protection of unearthed waterlogged archaeological artifacts is a heavy task when large-scale construction is carried out in today's China. Freeze drying offers an efficient way for preserving wooden artifacts. In order to rationally design the freeze drying process, thermophysical studies were carried out in this paper. The measurements of water vapor diffusion coefficient and thermal conductivity were made. The impacts of cooling velocity and grain orientation on effective diffusion coefficient of water vapor, D, in dried wood were investigated. At low cooling velocity, 0.2 K\/min, D was (4.8 +\/- 0.4) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in parallel grain direction, or (1.9 +\/- 0.4) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in perpendicular grain direction; at higher cooling velocity, 3.0 K\/min, D was (4.3 +\/- 0.2) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in parallel grain direction, or (1.2 +\/- 0.1) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in perpendicular grain direction. The thermal conductivity of the dried sample was in the range of 0.78-1.06 W\/(m K). With the values attained, one-dimensional pseudo-steady analysis were made for the primary drying process of a cylinder and a flat slab. It was found that the process was mass-transfer controlled and the difference between surface temperature and sublimation temperature was very limited. Thus only mass transfer equation needed to be solved with assumption of constant sublimation temperature. The primary drying of a two-dimensional object was also simulated to predict the time required. Monitoring the surface temperature of each artifact and handling artifacts with similar drying time in a batch are proposed for the freeze drying of archaeological artifacts. The freeze-dried wooden artifacts by the authors yielded very small deformations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The application of the statistic control in the electrospinning process is a premise for the production of highly uniform nanofibers with pre-established characteristics. The utilization of statistic control permits the evaluation of the state of static and dynamic stability, with significant implications in nanofibers quality. The polyetherimide-based nanofibers were obtained with modular electrospinning equipment, using as solvents dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfoxide. The values of fibers diameters were statistically processed, with the aim to improve the processing quality and to reduce the variability of technological electrospinning parameters.","3126":"Hydrogen production through the reduction of water has emerged as an important strategy for the storage of renewable energy in chemical bonds. One attractive scenario for the construction of efficient devices for electrochemical splitting of water requires the attachment of stable and active hydrogen evolving catalysts to electrode surfaces, which remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate here the successful integration of cobalt dithiolene catalysts into a metal-organic surface to generate very active electrocatalytic cathode materials for hydrogen generation from water. These surfaces display high catalyst loadings and remarkable stability even under very acidic aqueous solutions.","1393":"Elastomers such as polyurethanes usually possess low stiffness, and the addition of traditional fillers typically results in a moderate improvement. Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) represent one of the most promising nanoscale building blocks for high-performance nanocomposites. In this work, waterborne polyurethanes (PUs) have been reinforced with ANFs using two solution processing methods, namely, layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique and the vacuum-assisted flocculation (VAF) method. Record-high modulus of 5.275 GPa and ultimate strength of 98.02 MPa are obtained among all the reported PU based nanocomposites. We attribute such achievement to the similar molecular structures of ANFs with PUs which ensures a high affinity made possible by the manifold interfacial interactions. The formation of multiple hydrogen bonds due to the presence of amide groups with appropriate spacing in both components is confirmed by the computer simulation. Compared with the VAF method, it is found that LBL assembly allows a better load transfer, resulting in higher ultimate strength and stiffness. The VAF method shows advantages in improving the ultimate strength at low loadings of ANFs. We believe our work may not only lead to a new practical combination within the field of composite materials but also provide important implications for the future design of nanocomposites based on the innovative nanofillers.","1142":"Engineering bone tissue is particularly challenging because of the distinctive structural features of bone within a complex biochemical environment. In the present study, we fabricated poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) electrospun nanofibers with random and aligned morphology immobilized with bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) and investigated how these signals modulate (1) in vitro osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and (2) in vivo bone growth rate, mechanical properties, and collagen assembly of newly formed bone. The orientation of adherent cells followed the underlying nanofiber morphology; however, nanofiber alignment did not show any difference in alkaline phosphate activity or in calcium mineralization of hMSCs after 14 days of in vitro culture in osteogenic differentiation media. In vivo bone regeneration was significantly higher in the nanofiber implanted groups (approximately 65-79%) as compared to the defect-only group (11.8 +\/- 0.2%), while no significant difference in bone regeneration was observed between random and aligned groups. However, nanoindentation studies of regenerated bone revealed Young's modulus and contact hardness with anisotropic feature for aligned group as compared to random group. More importantly, structural analysis of collagen at de novo bone showed the ability of nanofiber morphology to guide collagen deposition. SEM and TEM images revealed regular, highly ordered collagen assemblies on aligned nanofibers as compared to random fibers, which showed irregular, randomly organized collagen deposition. Taken together, we conclude that nanofibers in the presence of osteoinductive signals are a potent tool for bone regeneration, and nanofiber alignment can be used for engineering bone tissues with structurally assembled collagen fibers with defined direction.","997":"Single-size 400 nm-SiO2 and multi-size 1 and 5 mu m-SiO2 were used as fillers in epoxy matrix. The fillers with the larger particle size and multi-size SiO2 particles mixing is beneficial to lower the viscosity and increase the filler loading. Among the composites, the 60 wt% 5 mu m-SiO2 epoxy composite has the best properties with both low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of 28.8 ppm\/A degrees C and low viscosity of similar to 50 Pa s, which shows its capability to achieve the required low CTE and viscosity values in the electronic packaging. Different theoretical proposals were used to estimate the CTE. Maxwell-Garnett equation fits the experimental data well. In addition, the mixture law and Bruggeman effective medium theory offer the upper and lower limits to the CTE.","1880":"The members of the rhodopsin family of proteins are involved in many essential light-dependent processes in biology. Specific photoisomerization of the protein-bound retinylidene PSB at a specified wavelength range of light is at the heart of all of these systems. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to reproduce in an engineered system. We have developed rhodopsin mimics, using intracellular lipid binding protein family members as scaffolds, to study fundamental aspects of protein\/chromophore interactions. Herein we describe a system that specifically isomerizes the retinylidene protonated Schiff base both thermally and photochemically. This isomerization has been characterized at atomic resolution by quantitatively interconverting the isomers in the crystal both thermally and photochemically. This event is accompanied by a large pK(a) change of the imine similar to the pK(a) changes observed in bacteriorhodopsin and visual opsins during isomerization.","4562":"We demonstrate that inverse woodpile and woodpile photonic crystal nanocrystalline silicon structures may be engineered for light trapping in solar cells. We use finite-difference timdomain simulations to show that the geometry of these photonic crystals may be varied such that absorption in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum may all be improved. The short-circuit current density and ultimate efficiency are also improved. We found a 77.1% and 106% absorption enhancement in the optimized inverse woodpile and woodpile structures respectively, compared to a nanocrystalline silicon thin film of the equivalent thickness. The inverse woodpile structures may be approximated as a thin film with effective index of refraction, whereas the woodpile structures exhibit resonances from the coupling of TE and TM leaky modes in the stacked cylinders. Woodpile photonic crystal structures exhibit improved performance compared to inverse woodpile structures over a range of equivalent thicknesses and incidence angles. The performance of woodpile structures is also generally insensitive to the diameter, pitch and number of layers, whereas inverse woodpile structures are much more sensitive to morphology.","4192":"It is well-known that homogeneous electric fields can be used to generate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Herein we report an interesting phenomenon of formation of GUVs and lipid tubes simultaneously using a nonhomogeneous electric field generated by point-to-plane electrodes. The underlying mechanism was analyzed using finite element analysis. The two forces play main roles, that is, the pulling force (F) to drag GUVs into lipid tubes induced by fluid flow, and the critical force (Fc) to prevent GUVs from deforming into lipid tubes induced by electric fields. In the center area underneath the needle electrode, the GUVs were found because F is less than Fc in that region, whereas in the edge area the lipid tubes were obtained because F is larger than Fc. The diffusion coefficient of lipid in the tubes was found to be 4.45m(2)s(-1) using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique. The method demonstrated here is superior to conventional GUV or lipid tube fabrication methods, and has great potential in cell mimic or hollow material fabrication using GUVs and tubes as templates.","1858":"We demonstrate doctor blading technique to fabricate high performance transistors made up of printed small molecular materials. In this regard, we synthesize a new soluble phthalocyanine, tetra-n-butyl peripheral substituted copper(II) phthalocaynine (CuBuPc), that can easily undergo gel formation upon ultrasonic irradiation, leading to the formation of three-dimensional (3D) network composed of one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers structure. Finally, taking the advantage of thixotropic nature of the CuBuPc organogel, we use the doctor blade processing technique that limits the material wastage for the fabrication of transistor devices. Due to the ultrasound induced stronger pi-pi interaction, the transistor fabricated by doctor blading based on CuBuPc organogel exhibits significant increase in charge carrier mobility in comparison with other solution process techniques, thus paving a way for a simple and economically viable preparation of electronic circuits.","561":"We have realized the highly sensitive, selective ppm-level carbon monoxide (CO) detection based on graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets-loaded SnO2 nanofibers with simultaneous Au functionalization. The interplay between RGO\/Au and SnO2 in terms of transfer of charge carriers and modulation of potential barriers is responsible for the exceptionally high CO detectability.","2338":"A simple and effective laboratory test methodology was developed for differentiating wildland fire chemicals based on the ignition time of vegetative fuel samples. The test apparatus consisted of an electric-powered radiant heater that was used to produce a uniform radiant thermal load to ignite the vegetative fuel samples. The samples, treated with wildland fire chemicals, were mounted on to a load cell to determine the transient mass loss during the combustion process. A custom-built heat flux sensor, that was modified and tested to reduce high errors, was used to determine the time to flaming ignition. The time to flaming ignition was also measured using transient mass loss data of the vegetative fuel samples. Statistical t-test analysis was conducted on the time to flaming ignition to determine whether the results were statistically significant for the different chemical treatments. The results indicated that the test methodology allowed for effective differentiation between the wildland fire chemical treatments by comparing their mean ignition times. The narrow standard deviations of the average ignition times suggested that the test methodology was able to produce repeatable results.","3355":"The present work aims to develop a method for preparation of porous iron oxide nanomaterials and to investigate the applicability as smart self-healing protective coatings for steel. In this respect, iron oxide nanoparticles doped with iodine and capped with natural modified rosin surfactant were prepared and applied as self-healing materials to repair the cracks of epoxy coats. The mechanism of self-healing characteristics of porous nanomaterials was elucidated using different analyses. The results suggested the formation of stable thin films on the cracks and holes of epoxy coats. Polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed an improvement in the corrosion resistance of the epoxy coating. The presence of nanoparticles was found to be an effective in restricting the penetration of aggressive ions by forming a strong barrier layer at coating metal interface.","4738":"Polymeric three-dimensional inverse-opal (JO) structures provide unique structural properties useful for various applications ranging from optics to separation technologies. Despite vast needs for IO functionalization to impart additional chemical properties, this task has been seriously challenged by the intrinsic limitation of polymeric porous materials that do not allow for the easy penetration of waterborne moieties or precursors. To overcome this restriction, we present a robust and straightforward method of employing a dipping-based surface modification with polydopamine (PDA) inside the IO structures, and demonstrate their application to catalytic membranes via synthetic incorporation of Ag nanoparticles. The PDA coating offers and successful creation of nucleation sites for a reduction of growth of the Ag nanoparticles. The resulting Ag nanoparticleincorporated IC) structures are utilized as catalytic membranes for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to its amino derivatives in the presence of NaBH4. Synergistically combined characteristics of high reactivity of Ag nanoparticles along with a greatly enhanced internal surface area of IO structures enable the implementation of remarkably improved catalytic performance, exhibiting a good conversion efficiency greater than 99% while minimizing loss in the membrane permeability.","4960":"A revolutionary impact on the performance of many optical systems and components can come from the integrative design of multifunctional coatings. Such coatings should be mechanically robust, and combine user-defined optical and wetting functions with scalable fabrication formulations. By taking cues from the properties of some natural biological structures, we report here the formation of low-refractive index antireflective glass films that embody omni-directional optical properties over a wide range of wavelengths, while also possessing specific wetting capabilities. The coatings comprise an interconnected network of nanoscale pores surrounded by a nanostructured silica framework. These structures result from a novel fabrication method that utilizes metastable spinodal phase separation in glass-based materials. The approach not only enables design of surface microstructures with graded-index antireflection characteristics, where the surface reflection is suppressed through optical impedance matching between interfaces, but also facilitates self-cleaning ability through modification of the surface chemistry. Based on near complete elimination of Fresnel reflections (yielding 495% transmission through a single-side coated glass) and corresponding increase in broadband transmission, the fabricated nanostructured surfaces are found to promote a general and an invaluable similar to 3-7% relative increase in current output of multiple direct\/indirect bandgap photovoltaic cells. Moreover, these antireflective surfaces also demonstrate superior resistance against mechanical wear and abrasion. Unlike conventional counterparts, the present antireflective coatings are essentially monolithic, enabling simultaneous realization of graded index anti-reflectivity, self-cleaning capability, and mechanical stability within the same surface. The concept represents a fundamental basis for development of advanced coated optical quality products, especially where environmental exposure is required.","334":"Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) hydrogen production from renewable energy sources (e. g. water, biomass, etc.) has become attractive in the field of renewable energy technology. The potential improvement of hydrogen production processes involves the reduction of the oxidation reaction overpotential, as well as the prohibition of photo-generated electron-hole combination in the photoelectrocatalytic process. Herein, we present high efficiency hydrogen production from PEC glucose oxidation by employing the ultrathin carbon-coated perovskite (Cr-doped SrTiO3) modified TiO2 nanotube photonic crystal (C@CrSrTiO3\/TiO2 NTPC) as a photoanode material. The photocurrent density of the C@ Cr-SrTiO3\/TiO2 NTPC photoanode reached as high as 0.43 mA cm(-2) at the bias potential of 0.6 V (vs. SCE) and in glucose electrolyte, which is about 4.8 and 3.3 times higher than that of TiO2 NTPC and C@ Cr-SrTiO3\/TiO2 NTPC photoanode in pure KOH electrolyte, respectively. The excellent PEC activity and photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to the less endergonic process of glucose oxidation compared to water oxidation. Additionally, the rational design and fabrication of C@ Cr-SrTiO3\/TiO2 NTPC is favorable towards the high-efficiency generation and transfer of photo-generated electrons, due to the high electrical conductivity and fast transport characteristics of the ultrathin carbon layer, the superior visible light absorption properties of Cr-SrTiO3 and the independently modulating carrier diffusion length of TiO2 NTPC. A probable mechanism for PEC hydrogen production from glucose oxidation over the ultrathin carbon-coated heterostructure photoanode is proposed and discussed.","6257":"Chromium (Cr) is an abundant heavy metal in nature, toxic to living organisms. As it is widely used in industry and leather tanning, it may accumulate locally at high concentrations, raising concerns for human health hazards. Though Cr effects have extensively been investigated in animals and mammals, in plants they are poorly understood. The present study was then undertaken to determine the ultrastructural malformations induced by hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], the most toxic form provided as 100 M potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), in the root tip cells of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A concentration-dependent decrease of root growth and a time-dependent increase of dead cells, callose deposition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and peroxidase activity were found in Cr(VI)-treated seedlings, mostly at the transition root zone. In the same zone, nuclei remained ultrastructurally unaffected, but in the meristematic zone some nuclei displayed bulbous outgrowths or contained tubular structures. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was less affected under Cr(VI) stress, but Golgi bodies appeared severely disintegrated. Moreover, mitochondria and plastids became spherical and displayed translucent stroma with diminished internal membranes, but noteworthy is that their double-membrane envelopes remained structurally intact. Starch grains and electron dense deposits occurred in the plastids. Amorphous material was also deposited in the cell walls, the middle lamella and the vacuoles. Some vacuoles were collapsed, but the tonoplast appeared integral. The plasma membrane was structurally unaffected and the cytoplasm contained opaque lipid droplets and dense electron deposits. All electron dense deposits presumably consisted of Cr that is sequestered from sensitive sites, thus contributing to metal tolerance. It is concluded that the ultrastructural changes are reactive oxygen species (ROS)-correlated and the malformations observed are organelle specific.","5201":"In this work, we have successfully developed three-dimensional (3D) nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2))\/singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWNT) gel composites for supercapacitor applications. The composites are prepared using a facile coating-aging method followed by an electrochemical deposition. The obtained SWNT gels and their derived Ni(OH)(2)\/SWNT composites present 3D network structures composed of randomly orientated nanotube bundles. It is found that the sizes of these bundles can be easily tuned using two different drying techniques. The directly dried Ni(OH)(2)\/SWNT composites with seriously bundled nanotubes are capable of maintaining an excellent discharge performance as well as a satisfactory cycling stability. The improved electrochemical performance of the Ni(OH)(2)\/SWNT xerogel composite comes from a 3D SWNT conductive highway and a stronger Ni(OH)(2)\/SWNT interface bonding. In contrast, the hydrogel composite prepared in the absence of a drying process, despite achieving both high areal and mass-based capacitance, suffers a severe cycling drop. Compared with 3D graphene and its derived composites, our composite design with the employment of 1D SWNTs has the merit of shorter ion diffusion distances which offers a distinctive opportunity for the future development of 3D electrodes.","2742":"Carbon materials have attracted great interest as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high performance and low cost. Here, we studied natural wood fiber derived hard carbon anodes for SIBs considering the abundance and low cost of wood. We discovered that a thermal carbonization of wood fiber led to a porous carbon with a high specific surface area of 586 m(2) g(-1), while a pretreatment with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) could effectively decrease it to 126 m(2) g(-1). When evaluating them as anodes for SIBs, we observed that the low surface area carbon resulted in a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 72% compared to 25% of the high surface area carbon. More importantly, the low surface area carbon exhibits an excellent cycling stability that a desodiation capacity of 196 mAh g(-1) can be delivered over 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), indicating a promising anode for low-cost SIBs.","2473":"A continuum material model is developed for simulating the mechanical response of high-density cellulose-based materials subjected to stationary and transient loading. The model is formulated in an infinitesimal strain framework, where the total strain is decomposed into elastic and plastic parts. The model adopts a standard linear viscoelastic solid model expressed in terms of Boltzmann hereditary integral form, which is coupled to a rate-dependent viscoplastic formulation to describe the irreversible plastic part of the overall strain. An anisotropic hardening law with a kinematic effect is particularly adopted in order to capture the complex stress-strain hysteresis typically observed in polymeric materials. In addition, the present model accounts for the effects of material densification associated with through-thickness compression, which are captured using an exponential law typically applied in the continuum description of elasticity in porous media. Material parameters used in the present model are calibrated to the experimental data for high-density (press)boards. The experimental characterization procedures as well as the calibration of the parameters are highlighted. The results of the model simulations are systematically analyzed and validated against the corresponding experimental data. The comparisons show that the predictions of the present model are in very good agreement with the experimental observations for both stationary and transient load cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To study the metal-insulator-transition (MIT) mechanism and extend the applications of VO2 epitaxial films at terahertz (THz) band, temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD) and THz time domain spectroscopy of the VO2 epitaxial films were performed. Both the lattice constants and THz transmission exhibited a similar and sharp transition that was similar to that observed for the electrical resistance. Consequently, the MIT of the VO2\/Al2O3 epitaxial films should be co-triggered by the structural phase transition and electronic transition. Moreover, the very large resistance change (on the order of similar to 10(3)) and THz response (with a transmission modulation ratio of similar to 87%) in the VO2\/Al2O3 epitaxial heterostructures are promising for electrical switch and electro-optical device applications.

It was found that TCBT with a tert-butyl moiety could gel cyclohexane, cyclopentanol and octane\/cyclohexane (v\/v = 2\/1) under ultrasound stimulus, but CBT without a tert-butyl group failed to form an organogel in the selected solvents, revealing that tert-butyl played an important role in gel formation. X-ray diffraction patterns of xerogels indicated that TCBT molecules self-assembled into a lamellar structure in the gel state. In particular, xerogel-based films of TCBT emitted strong blue light and could be used as fluorescent sensory materials to detect acid vapors of TFA, HCl, HNO3, formic acid and acetic acid with high performance on account of the good adsorption and diffusion of analytes in 3D networks consisting lots of nanofibers as well as the efficient exciton migration in nanofibers. It suggested that the organogelation of pi-gelators was a facile way to generate efficient chemosensors.","23":"Porous carbon materials stemming from biomass have drawn increasing interest because of their sustainable properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three basic components of crude biomass, and were investigated to reveal their influence on the derived carbonaceous materials. Huge amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups in cellulose and hemicellulose tend to be eliminated as H2O, CO2, and CO and give micropores during pyrolysis, whereas lignin contains plentiful aromatic units which are chemically inert, and thus produce nonporous carbon materials. When the KHCO3 was introduced during the pyrolysis process, the plentiful hydroxyl in cellulose and hemicellulose underwent dehydration condensation among different parent polymers, which are responsible for the formation of macroporous structure. By contrast, The beta-O-4 bands in lignin experience homolysis and give rise to benzene-containing units, which finally result in carbon nanosheets. Furthermore, we demonstrated the mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin can display a three-dimensional porous structure (containing macropores, mesopores, and micropores) when less than SO% of lignin is contained.","2264":"The electrospinning method was used for the preparation of polymeric nanofibrous layers made of polymers with possible use in the biomedical field. Various samples were prepared using combinations of polycaprolactone or poly(ethylene)oxide and hyaluronic acid. In both cases, nanofibrous layers were spun solely from a water solution. Using confocal Raman spectroscopy we were able to distinguish substantial variations in the distribution of the polymers caused by various preparation parameters and to characterize the prepared samples. Moreover, combining Raman spectroscopy with a mathematical method-singular value decomposition-enabled us to determine the ratios between the polymers used and thus to show the distribution of the present chemical constituents within a localized sample area. This may prove useful for the checking of production of nanofibrous products.","6068":"Growing soft tissue with a confined boundary is accompanied by a large strain and stress which lead to instability and the formation of surface wrinkling, folding or creasing. This paper presents the morphological evolution of the growth of a biological tube composed of a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material within a confined environment. Critical growth ratios for the triggering of creases or detachment from the contacting boundary have been investigated both analytically and numerically. Results show that compressive residual stresses induced by confined growth of the tubular tissue can lead to a variety of surface folding patterns which strongly depend on the thickness of the tube. In a thick tube creases begin to form at the inner surface of the tube and in a thin tube the structure detaches from the confining wall. Between these two extremes there is a transitional area wherein the tube starts to crease at first and then detaches from the confining wall. Further modeling reveals that a gap between the tube and the confinement can tune the shape evolution of the growing biological tube. These findings may provide some fundamental understanding to growth modeling of complicated biological phenomena such as cortical folding of the brain and the growth of solid tumors.","6785":"Paulownia wood processing residues were adopted as both a template and precursor for the synthesis of a wood-derived biochar\/polypyrrole (coded as WDB\/PPy) composite via a simple cost-effective in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. The WDB substrate was encapsulated with plenty of PPy nanoparticles with diameters of a few hundred nanometers, and the resultant WDB\/PPy composite can be utilized as a free-standing and binder-free supercapacitor electrode. This hybrid electrode has a high specific capacitance of 216 F g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1), an excellent coulombic efficiency of more than 98%, and a favorable cyclic stability with 96.9% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. These results offer a low-cost eco-friendly design of electrode materials for supercapacitors. More importantly, this cheap and environmentally benign WDB substrate is expected to integrate with more types of electrochemically active substances to develop novel energy storage devices.","5505":"Ellipsoid-shaped nanoclusters composed of single superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be generated by emulsion electrospinning. Stretching and subsequent solvent evaporation of iron oxide loaded emulsion droplets during the emulsion electrospinning process enables the creation of such structures embedded in polymer nanofibers. Dissolution of the polymer fibers yields an aqueous dispersion of the inorganic clusters which are the first example of ellipsoid-shaped superparamagnetic nanoclusters with a high saturation magnetization (similar to 47 emu g(-1)).","7259":"The Woodward-Hoffmann rules determine a first level of selectivity in pericyclic reactions. In this framework torqueselectivity can be defined as an additional degree of selectivity in electrocyclizations favouring one of the two allowed pathways. In this communication we extend this second level of selectivity beyond electrocyclizations. We have designed substrates that undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement in a torqueselective fashion. This behaviour is conformation dependent and is only observed when the reaction proceeds via a boat transition state. Structural design aimed at conformational control at the transition state, ensuring a boat-like structure, provides the first example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift that occurs with torqueselectivity.","4030":"A novel porous hybrid imprinted membrane (CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM) was prepared that could selectively anchor and separate target proteins from a complex matrix. CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM exhibits many of the advantages of molecularly imprinted polymers and membranes, including the high selectivity of MIPs, the lower energy consumption and the ability to continuously separate mixtures via membrane separation. The surface morphologies and physical\/chemical properties of the different membranes were investigated using FTIR, XRD, DSC, XPS and SEM. The results showed that the different molecules contained within CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM were homogeneous; two different sizes of imprinted cavities were observed in CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM, which facilitate the selective anchoring property. The adsorption capacities, swelling behaviors and mechanical properties of the different constituent membranes were also compared. The results show that the adhesion and nonspecific adsorption properties of the membrane were manifestly reduced through the addition of PVP. The binding capacity and adsorption selectivity of the membrane were apparently improved because of the presence of dopamine. MWCNTs obviously improved the mechanical strength of the membranes. CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM was successfully applied to separate bovine serum albumin from bovine blood. CP\/CNT\/DA-MIM is an economical, hydrophilic and ecofriendly membrane and is a promising separation material for the large-scale continuous selective separation of target proteins from complex matrices in commercial applications.","7397":"We applied carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets, which are high-purity and suitable for mass production, to field-emission lamps (FELs) with vacuum-sealed diode structures. Three such FELs were designed and fabricated to correspond to the field-emission characteristics of individual CNT sheets. We suppressed the variation in the anode-cathode voltage to within the range of 5.4-6.0 kV, which contributes to the light output of the FELs. The stabilities of the FELs ranged from -0.65% to 0.26% in the short term; therefore, we confirmed that the high-purity CNT sheets were stable during operation. All FELs could be operated for 500 h without significant degradation, even when the FEL was operated in a passive vacuum instead of a dynamic vacuum.","3501":"High-surface-area microporous carbons with controllable nitrogen doping were prepared via a novel organic-inorganic sol-gel approach, using phenolic resol and hexamethoxymethyl melamine (HMMM) as carbon precursors, and partially hydrolyzed tetraethoxysilane as silica template. The pore structures of microporous carbons were completely replicated from a thin silica framework and could be tailored greatly by changing the organic\/inorganic ratio. The nitrogen atoms doped into the carbon framework were issued from high-nitrogen-content HMMM precursors, and the nitrogen content could be adjusted in a wide range by changing the phenolic resol\/HMMM ratio. Moreover, the porous structure and nitrogen content could be simultaneously controlled, allowing the preparation of a series of microporous carbons with almost the same microstructures (BET surface areas of ca.1900 m(2).g(-1) and pore volumes of ca. 1.2 cm(3).g(-1), and the same pore size distributions) but with different nitrogen contents (0-12 wt %). These results provided a general method to synthesize nitrogen-doped microporous carbons and allowed these materials to serve as a model system to illustrate the role of nitrogen content on the performance of the carbons. When used as the supports for sulfur cathodes, only an appropriate nitrogen content of ca. 6.3 wt % was found to effectively improve sulfur utilization and cycle life of the sulfur cathodes. The resulting sulfur cathodes could deliver an outstanding reversible discharge capacity of 1054 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 C after 100 cycles.","5087":"A series of biomacromolecular logic gates and functional devices with cyclic voltammetric (CV) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) responses as output signals were established on the basis of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film electrodes. The MIP films were electropolymerized on the surface of Au electrodes with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as the monomer and chloramphenicol (CP) as the template molecule. The simultaneous CV and ECL signals of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) were significantly enhanced by the addition of natural DNA in solution at the MIP film electrodes after CP removal. The CV and ECL responses of the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) DNA system at the MIP film electrodes were greatly influenced by CP removal and rebinding. Moreover, the addition of ferrocene methanol (FcMeOH) to the solution led to substantial quenching of the ECL signal and produced a new CV peak pair. On the basis of these results, 3-input\/3-output and 3-input\/S-output biomacromolecular logic gate systems were established with DNA, CP, and FcMeOH as inputs and the ECL responses at different levels or CV responses at different potentials as outputs. After an elaborate reconfiguration of inputs and outputs, the functional non-Boolean logic devices such as a 2-to-1 encoder, a 1-to-2 decoder, and a 1-to-2 demultiplexer were also constructed on the same platform.","3194":"Magnetic hybrid nanocomposite material based on the kraft lignin was prepared by the co-precipitating method. Kraft lignin was modified by iron nanooxide in order to enhance its sorption properties towards heavy metal ions. The composite material was characterized by physicochemical methods such as BET N-2, ATR-FTIR, TGA, DSC, pH(pzc), XRD and SEM. Its adsorption behaviour was studied using the batch mode by varying different parameters like pH, initial concentration of metal ions and shaking time as well as the presence of interfering ions. Adsorption of Cu(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions from the aqueous solutions was studied in comparison with the commercial kraft lignin. The adsorption capacity and kinetic sorption characteristics of the composite material were determined.","1562":"Hierarchically porous Cu-Ni\/C composite catalysts were successfully fabricated by a bio-inspired route involving impregnation and calcination processes. Macoporous networks composed of interwoven carbon fibers loaded with nano Cu-Ni particles, which had high surface area (538 m(2)\/g), were prepared by template-directed synthesis employing tissue paper as bio-templates. The obtained hierarchically porous structures exhibited high catalytic activity for acid fuchsin degradation in the MICO process due to the synergetic effects between the microwave (MW), porous carbon and Cu-Ni nano particles. The degradation of acid fuchsin was a fast process under MW irritation. Not only the chromophore group but also the naphthalene ring and benzene ring in acid fuchsin molecule can be destroyed mostly. Ni addition had a significant effect on the acid fuchsin degradation because it benefited more formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH)-O-center dot under MW irritation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanostructured polypyrrole is rooted on the surface of protein microfibers like \"taste buds\". Such modification not only eliminated the issue of protein shrinkage in the liquid medium, but also significantly improved the film's mechanical strength and wettability. The ultrathin fibrous films exhibited a \"metallic\" character, and could effectively respond to temperature changes, and thus have potential to be used as flexible materials for sensors and electronic devices.","5584":"An eumelanin-inspired core derived from the natural product, vanillin (vanilla bean extract) was utilized for the synthesis of eumelani-ninspired small molecules and polymer via Sonogashira cross coupling. The materials demonstrate that the methyl 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dimethoxy-N-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate core can serve as a new building block for organic semiconductors.","3003":"Graphene-based composites have been deemed as promising materials in renewable energy-storage applications. Herein, we report a hybrid architecture consisting of layered molybdenum sulfide nanosheets\/N-doped graphene (MoS2\/NG) synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. By adjusting precursor ratios, flower-like MoS2\/NG hybrid with nitrogen content of 3.5 at.% on the graphene layers can be obtained. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that the maximum specific capacitance of the MoS2\/NG electrodes reaches up to 245F\/g at 0.25A\/g (and 146F\/g at 20A\/g). In addition, the electrode exhibits superior cyclic stability with 91.3% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 2A\/g. The outstanding performance of the MoS2\/NG hybrid benefits from the synergistic effect between the layered MoS2 and N-doped graphene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The calculations were performed on dimers up to octamers in the neutral and ionic species using the B3LYP\/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The results obtained show that the conjugated systems in the p- and n-doped oligomers had more aromaticity, with expanded and planar chains. The calculated energy gap values between the frontier molecular orbitals for the end-capped oligomers were larger than those for the unsubstituted oligomers, in which with increase in the oligomer chain length, the conduction band gap decreased. The calculated first excitation energies of BRnTs at the TD-B3LYP\/6-31G(d,p) level indicated that both doped oligomers (p- and n-type) had lower excitation energies than the neutral states, and that they displayed red shifts in their absorption spectra. Moreover, the results obtained for the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed that closing the end-side oligothiophene chains with the aminoalkyl groups eased the hole or electron transfer, owning to better charge delocalization through the backbone structures of BRnTs.

As such, nanosilver-hybridized WO3 nanofibers incorporating paramagnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were for the first time fabricated following three aspects of morphological control-bulk crystallinity, fiber chemical compositions, and surface modifications. Experimentally, co-precipitation, eletrospinning, and photodeposition were employed to synthesize CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, generate magnetically recoverable solar light-active photocatalyst nanofibers, and decorate them with nanosilver, respectively. The successful synthetic steps represented a facile and scalable route to multifunctional nanocatalyst against waterborne pollutants with organic and microbial constituents via WO3 photocatalytic system. The work extended to nanofiber fabrication using the NS LAB 500 Nanospider machine which allowed for the pilot-scale hybrid nanofibrous catalyst effective under natural sunlight towards elimination of a model waterborne pollutant.","7328":"A novel high-performance electrode material, nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel\/cobalt oxide (NCA\/Co3O4) material, was prepared by a facile, one step and in situ coating method, followed by a freeze-drying process. The effects of different amounts of Co3O4 on the structural properties, specific surface areas, elemental compositions and electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes were investigated. Consequently, the electrode with 75% mass content of Co3O4 exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, in particular, a high specific capacitance of 616 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability (445 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)) and outstanding cycle performance. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with NCA\/Co3O4-3 and NCA electrodes could be cycled in a high voltage range of 1.5 V and deliver a maximum energy density of 33.43 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 375 W kg(-1). The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the complementary contributions of the 3D interconnected porous structure and the efficient pseudocapacitance of the uniformly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles. The preparation method offers a new fabrication strategy to in situ fabricate carbon-supported metal oxide electrodes for high-performance energy storage applications.","6557":"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were used to reinforce silica aerogels, aiming to ameliorate the aerogels' inherent brittleness. The CNF-reinforced silica aerogels were prepared through the elaboration of silica particles interpenetrated with a nanocellulosic network structure by immersion of the CNF aerogels into a silica solution in a two-step sol-gel process (first, hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and second, condensation under alkaline conditions). The relationships among the silica content, the density, and the compressive properties of the composite aerogels were investigated. A response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the preparation process (CNF concentration, TEOS concentration, pH value of condensation process and immersion time) with the target being to synthesize a desired aerogel with improved mechanical properties. The results show that density can be seen as a function of the silica content, and that the two had a positive dependent relationship. The compressive properties were also greatly affected by the silica loading into the cellulosic scaffold. The composite aerogel displayed high compressive properties at 40-50 wt% silica particles. The optimal condition would be a CNF aerogel of 5% solid content immersed into a 2.5 mol L-1 TEOS sol with condensation at pH value of 10 for 10 min. The compressive modulus (6.57 MPa) and compressive strength (1.37 MPa) of the composite aerogel greatly exceeded those of the pure silica aerogel, without substantial increases in density (0.1 g cm(-3)). The composite aerogel also had good insulation properties (thermal conductivity was 0.0226 W m(-1) K-1) and hydrophobicity (contact angle 152.1 degrees) and thus can be considered as a multi-functional aerogel capable of applications in a wide variety of areas.","2080":"CONSPECTUS: Nature has developed a fascinating strategy of cryptobiosis (\"secret life\") for counteracting the stressful, and often lethal, environmental conditions that fluctuate sporadically over time. For example, certain bacteria sporulate to transform from a metabolically active, vegetative state to an ametabolic endospore state. The bacterial endospores, encased within tough biomolecular shells, withstand the extremes of harmful stressors, such as radiation, desiccation, and malnutrition, for extended periods of time and return to a vegetative state by breaking their protective shells apart when their environment becomes hospitable for living. Certain ciliates and even higher organisms, for example, tardigrades, and others are also found to adopt a cryptobiotic strategy for survival. A common feature of cryptobiosis is the structural presence of tough sheaths on cellular structures. However, most cells and cellular assemblies are not \"spore-forming\" and are vulnerable to the outside threats. In particular, mammalian cells, enclosed with labile lipid bilayers, are highly susceptible to in vitro conditions in the laboratory and daily life settings, making manipulation and preservation difficult outside of specialized conditions. The instability of living cells has been a main bottleneck to the advanced development of cell-based applications, such as cell therapy and cell based sensors. A judicious question arises: can cellular tolerance against harmful stresses be enhanced by simply forming cell-in shell hybrid structures? Experimental results suggest that the answer is yes. A micrometer-sized \"Iron Man\" can be generated by chemically forming an ultrathin (<100 nm) but durable shell on a \"non-spore-forming\" cell. Since the report on silica nanoencapsulation of yeast cells, in which cytoprotective yeast-in-silica hybrids were formed, several synthetic strategies have been developed to encapsulate individual cells in a cytocompatible fashion, mimicking the cryptobiotic cell-in-shell structures found in nature, for example, bacterial endospores. Bioinspired silicification and phenolics-based coatings are, so far, the main approaches to the formation of cytoprotective cell-in-shell hybrids, because they ensure cell viability during encapsulations and also generate durable nanoshells on cell surfaces. The resulting cell-in-shell hybrids extrinsically possess enhanced resistance to external aggressors, and more intriguingly, the encapsulation alters their metabolic activity, exemplified by retarded or suppressed cell cycle progression. In addition, recent developments in the field have further advanced the synthetic tools available to the stage of chemical sporulation and germination of mammalian cells, where cytoprotective shells are formed on labile mammalian cells and broken apart on demand. For example, individual HeLa cells are coated with a metal-organic complex of ferric ion and tannic acid, and cellular adherence and proliferation are controlled by the programmed shell formation and degradation. Based on these demonstrations, the (degradable) cell-in-shell hybrids are anticipated to find their applications in various biomedical and bionanotechnological areas, such as cytotherapeutics, high-throughput screening, sensors, and biocatalysis, as well as providing a versatile research platform for single-cell biology.","2181":"Artificial photosynthesis by harvesting solar light into chemical energy could solve the problems of energy conversion and storage in a sustainable way. In nature, CO2 and H2O are transformed into carbohydrates by photosynthesis to store the solar energy in chemical bonds and water is oxidized to O-2 in the oxygen-evolving center (OEC) of photosystem II (PS II). The OEC contains CaMn4O5 cluster in which the metals are interconnected through oxido bridges. Inspired by biological systems, manganese-oxide-based catalysts have been synthesized and explored for water oxidation. Structural, functional modeling, and design of the materials have prevailed over the years to achieve an effective and stable catalyst system for water oxidation. Structural flexibility with e(g)(1) configuration of Mn-III, mixed valency in manganese, and higher surface area are the main requirements to attain higher efficiency. This Minireview discusses the most recent progress in heterogeneous manganese-oxide-based catalysts for efficient chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical water oxidation as well as the structural requirements for the catalyst to perform actively.","6276":"In this study, monoclinic ZrO2 nanoparticles were successfully prepared using a hydrothermal process. When phenol was added to the resulting solution for the hydrothermal reaction, ZrO2\/phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins with tetragonal ZrO2 crystalline phases were synthesized. Tetragonal ZrO2 crystalline phases favor growth in solutions with high pH values and high OH-concentrations, which result from the formation of PF via the reaction of phenol and formaldehyde. Consequently, the transition of monoclinic ZrO2 to tetragonal ZrO2 is assisted by PF formation. Furthermore, tetragonal ZrO2\/CA structures with a high specific surface area of approximately 275.7 m(2) g(-1) were successfully prepared through carbonization of the resulting ZrO2\/PF structures, which greatly improved the aggregation phenomenon of ZrO2 nanoparticles with a specific surface area of ca. 16.1 m(2) g(-1). This study is the first report of the fabrication of tetragonal ZrO2 crystallites with the assistance of the formation of phenol formaldehyde resins during hydrothermal reactions. This method could be applied to other metal oxide crystallite systems in the future.","3392":"The operational constraints for a 6-electron\/6-proton CO2 reduction system that operates at the concentration of CO2 in the current atmosphere (p(CO2) = 400 ppm) have been evaluated on a variety of scale lengths that span from laboratory scale to global scale. Due to the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, limitations due to mass transport of CO2 from the tropopause have been evaluated through five different regions, each with different characteristic length scales: the troposphere; the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL); the canopy layer; a membrane layer; and an aqueous electrolyte layer. The resulting CO2 conductances, and associated physical transport limitations, will set the ultimate limit on the efficiency and areal requirements of a sustainable solar-driven CO2 reduction system regardless of the activity or selectivity of catalysts for reduction of CO2 at the molecular level. At the electrolyte\/electrode interface, the steady-state limiting current density and the concomitant voltage loss associated with the CO2 concentration overpotential in a one-dimensional solar-driven CO2 reduction cell have been assessed quantitatively using a mathematical model that accounts for diffusion, migration and convective transport, as well as for bulk electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte. At p(CO2) = 400 ppm, the low diffusion coefficient combined with the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions constrains the steady-state limiting current density to <0.1 mA cm(-2) in a typical electrochemical cell with natural convection and employing electrolytes with a range of pH values. Hence, in such a system, the CO2 capture area must be 100- to 1000-fold larger than the solar photon collection area to enable a >10% efficient solar-driven CO2 reduction system (based on the solar collection area). This flux limitation is consistent with estimates of oceanic CO2 uptake fluxes that have been developed in conjunction with carbon-cycle analyses for use in coupled atmosphere\/ocean general circulation models. Two strategies to improve the feasibility of obtaining efficient and sustainable CO2 transport to a cathode surface at p(CO2) = 400 ppm are described and modeled quantitatively. The first strategy employs yet unknown catalysts, analogous to carbonic anhydrases, that dramatically accelerate the chemically enhanced CO2 transport in the aqueous electrolyte layer by enhancing the acid-base reactions in a bicarbonate buffer system. The rapid interconversion from bicarbonate to CO2 in the presence of such catalysts near the cathode surface would in principle yield significant increases in the steady-state limiting current density and allow for >10% solar-fuel operation at the cell level. The second strategy employs a thin-layer cell architecture to improve the diffusive transport of CO2 by use of an ultrathin polymeric membrane electrolyte. Rapid equilibration of CO2 at the gas\/electrolyte interface, and significantly enhanced diffusive fluxes of CO2 in electrolytes, are required to increase the steady-state limiting current density of such a system. This latter approach however only is feasible for gaseous products, because liquid products would coat the electrode and therefore thicken the hydrodynamic boundary layer and accordingly reduce the diffusive CO2 flux to the electrode surface. Regardless of whether the limitations due to mass transport to the electrode surface are overcome on the laboratory scale, at global scales the ultimate CO2 flux limitations will be dictated by mass transport considerations related to transport of atmospheric CO2 to the boundary plane of the solar-driven reactor system. The transport of CO2 across the troposphere\/ABL interface, the ABL\/canopy layer interface, and the canopy layer\/electrolyte interface have therefore been assessed in this work, to provide upper bounds on the ultimate limits for the solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency for systems that are intended to effect the reduction of atmospheric CO2 in a sustainable fashion at global scale.","5102":"In this study, we systematically investigated the morphologies and luminescence properties of luminescent polymethacrylate composite nanofibers containing a benzoic acid rare earth complex. The analysis results indicated that the benzoic acid rare earth complex, Tb(4-methylbenzoic acid)(3)phen, was distributed uniformly in the polymethacrylate nanofibers, which were fabricated by electrostatic spinning. The Tb(4-methylbenzoic acid)(3)phen content in the polymethacrylate nanofibers was as high as 20% (mass%). The emission peaks of the as-prepared polymethacrylate composite nanofibers corresponded to the characteristic D-5(4)-F-7(6), (5, 4, 3) transitions of Tb3+ ions. The highest emission peak was observed at 548 nm and corresponded to the D-5(4)-F-7(5) transition. When the Tb(4-methylbenzoic acid)(3)phen content was less than 1%, even a 0.2% increase in the content increased the fluorescence intensity markedly. The thermal stability of the rare earth complex was higher in the as-prepared nanofibers; the initial decomposition temperature of the polymethacrylate composite nanofiber reached 291 degrees C. Composite nanofibers with different morphologies exhibited different luminescence characteristics. The fluorescence intensity and emission lifetime of porous nanobeads were nine and two times higher, respectively, than those of smooth nanofibers. The better morphological and luminescence properties exhibited by the synthesized luminescent polymethacrylate composite nanofibers should result in the use of benzoic acid rare earth complexes in a greater number of applications.

For the first time, the performance of the heat sinks has been related to the calculated energy yield of a standard triple-junction GaInP\/GaAs\/Ge HCPV cell in a system deployed at several suitable locations across the globe. Copper and aluminium heat sinks have been considered and their merits have been compared. The finite element analysis software package COMSOL was employed to gain insights regarding a simple flat plate heat sink. The cell temperature was found to have a linear dependence on the geometric concentration with a characteristic slope that increases with cell size (ranging from 10 to 0.25 mm). The results show the advantages of miniaturisation, and that the cooling of smaller cells can be accomplished using flat heat sinks. Within the considered range of geometric concentration ratios (up to 1000 x), aluminium heat sinks are, in general, found to be preferred over copper, because of their lower densities and costs for the same thermal management. Closed-form thermal models based on the Least-Material (LM) approach have been utilised to design more complex finned heat sinks (operated under natural convection) that yield the best compromise between thermal performance and weight. For a 60 degrees C cell operating temperature, a greater kWh output is obtained, but an LM heat sink designed for a cell temperature of 80 degrees C has a material cost per unit energy that is between 50% and 70% less than the one designed for 60 degrees C. Heat sink costs between $0.1 and 0.9 per W-p were estimated for a geometric concentration above 500 suns, depending on the cell's temperature and size. There are strong reductions in HCPV installation costs by limiting the dimensions of the cooling system at high concentrations. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Modified adsorbents were chemically characterized for their chemical composition and pHPZC (point of zero charge), while adsorption tests determined the best conditions of pH, adsorbent mass, and contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate in the process of removal of themetal ions. Isotherms obtained from the preliminary results were linearized by Langmuir's and Freudlich's models. The thermodynamic parameters, such as Delta H, Delta G, and Delta S, were also evaluated. The modifying solutions proposed were effective in the modification of adsorbents and resulted in high capacity sorption materials. Equilibrium time between adsorbent and adsorbate for the solutions contaminated with metals is about 40 minutes. The Langmuir model adjusted to most results, indicating monolayers adsorption of Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cr(III). The values obtained for Langmuir Q(m) show a higher adsorption capacity caused by chemical modifications, with values such as 19.54mg Cd(II) per g of M. NaOH, 42.46mg of Pb(II) per g of M. NaOH, and 43.97mg of Cr(III) per g of M H2O2. Results showed that modified cassava peels are excellent adsorbent, renewable, high availability, and low-cost materials and a feasible alternative in the removal of metals in industries.","1876":"We report the design of hydrogels that can act as \"smart\" valves or membranes. Each hydrogel is engineered with a pore (about 1 cm long and <1 mm thick) that remains closed under ambient conditions but opens under specific conditions. Our design is inspired by the stomatal valves in plant leaves, which regulate the movement of water and gases in and out of the leaves. The design features two different gels, active and passive, which are attached concentrically to form a disc-shaped hybrid film. The pore is created in the central active gel, and the conditions for opening the pore can be tuned based on the chemistry of this gel. For example, if the active gel is made from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA), the actuation of the pore depends on the temperature of water relative to 32 degrees C, which is the lower-critical solution temperature (LCST) of NIPA. The concentric design of our hybrid provides directionality to the volumetric transition of the active gel, i.e., it ensures that the pore opens as the active gel shrinks. In turn, contact with hot water (T > 32 degrees C) opens the pore and allows the water to pass through the gel. Conversely, the pore remains closed when the water is cold (T < 32 degrees C). The gel thereby acts as a \"smart\" valve that is able to regulate the flow of solvent depending on its properties. We have extended the concept to other stimuli that can cause gel-swelling transitions including solvent composition, pH, and light. Additionally, when two different gel based valves are arranged in series, the assembly acts as a logical \"AND\" gate, i.e., water flows through the valve-combination only if it simultaneously satisfies two distinct conditions (such as its pH being below a critical value and its temperature being above a critical value).","3388":"The thermal, rheological, and mechanical and dielectric relaxation properties of exfoliated dispersions of montmorillonite clay in a molecular liquid, polychlorobiphenyl (PCB), were studied. The viscosity enhancement at low concentrations of clay (r5%) exceeded by a factor of 50 the increase obtainable with conventional fillers. However, the effect of the nanoclay on the local dynamics, including the glass transition temperature, was quite small. All materials herein conformed to density-scaling of the reorientation relaxation time of the PCB for a common value of the scaling exponent. A new relaxation process was observed in the mixtures, associated with PCB molecules in proximity to the clay surface. This process has an anomalously high dielectric strength, suggesting a means to exploit nanoparticles to achieve large electrical energy absorption. This lower frequency dispersion has a weaker dependence on pressure and density, consistent with dynamics constrained by interactions with the particle surface.","3781":"A multifunctional magnetic 3D graphene\/Fe3O4 architecture (GFA) has been fabricated by a facile and scalable one-pot self-assembled strategy through hydrothermal treatment of a mixed aqueous precursor solution of graphene oxide (GO) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). Benefiting from the 3D porous structure and synergistic effects of the assembled graphene nanosheets and Fe3O4 NPs, the resultant GFA exhibits excellent adsorption capacities of not only organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB), but also toxic solvents such as toluene and chloroform, and improved electrochemical capacitive performances in comparison with pristine graphene architectures and Fe3O4 NPs. The impressive results presented here may have high impact on the future fabrication of functional graphene based architectures for practical applications.","5130":"The fabrication of large-scale, solid-supported lipid bilayer (SLB) arrays has traditionally been an arduous and complex task, primarily due to the need to maintain SLBs within an aqueous environment. In this work, we demonstrate the use of trehalose vitrified phospholipid vesicles that facilitate on-demand generation of microarrays, allowing each element a unique composition, for the label-free and high-throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions by SPR imaging (SPRi). Small, unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are suspended in trehalose, deposited in a spatially defined manner, with the trehalose vitrifying on either hydrophilic or hydrophobic SPR substrates. SLBs are subsequently spontaneously formed on-demand simply by in situ hydration of the array in the SPR instrument flow cell. The resulting SLBs exhibit high lateral mobility, characteristic of fluidic cellular lipid membranes, and preserve the biological function of embedded cell membrane receptors, as indicated by SPR affinity measurements. Independent fluorescence and SPR imaging studies show that the individual SLBs stay localized at the area of deposition, without any encapsulating matrix, confining coral, or boundaries. The introduced methodology allows individually addressable SLB arrays to be analyzed with excellent label-free sensitivity in a real-time, high-throughput manner. Various protein ganglioside interactions have been selected as a model system to illustrate discrimination of strong and weak binding responses in SPRi sensorgrams. This methodology has been applied toward generating hybrid bilayer membranes on hydrophobic SPR substrates, demonstrating its versatility toward a range of surfaces and membrane geometries. The stability of the fabricated arrays, over medium to long storage periods, was evaluated and found to be good. The highly efficient and easily scalable nature of the method has the potential to be applied to a variety of label-free sensing platforms requiring lipid membranes for high-throughput analysis of their properties and constituents.","1703":"The use of nanomaterials as an electroactive medium has improved the performance of bio\/chemical sensors, particularly when synergy is reached upon combining distinct materials. In this paper, we report on a novel architecture comprising electrospun polyamide 6\/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PA6\/PAH) nanofibers functionalized with multiwalled carbon nanotubes, used to detect the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). Miscibility of PA6 and PAH was sufficient to form a single phase material, as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), leading to nanofibers with no beads onto which the nanotubes could adsorb strongly. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed with indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes coated with the functionalized nanofibers for the selective electrochemical detection of dopamine (DA), with no interference from uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA) that are normally present in biological fluids. The response was linear for a DA concentration range from 1 to 70 mu mol L-1, with detection limit of 0.15 mu mol L-1 (S\/N = 3). The concepts behind the novel architecture to modify electrodes can be potentially harnessed in other electrochemical sensors and biosensors.","842":"Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a critical player of the maltose\/maltodextrin transport system in Escherichia coli. Our previous studies have revealed that MBP nonspecifically induces T helper type 1 (Th1) cell activation and activates peritoneal macrophages obtained from mouse. In the present study, we reported a direct stimulatory effect of MBP on RAW264.7 cells, a murine macrophage cell line. When stimulated with MBP, the production of nitric oxide (NO), IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12p70, and the expressions of CD80, MHC class II and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were all increased in RAW264.7 cells, indicating the activation and polarization of RAW264.7 cells into M1 macrophages induced by MBP. Further study showed that MBP stimulation upregulated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on RAW264.7 cells, which was accompanied by subsequent phosphorylation of IB- and p38 MAPK. Pretreatment with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibodies largely inhibited the phosphorylation of IB- and p38 MAPK, and greatly reduced MBP-induced NO and IL-12p70 production, suggesting that the MBP-induced macrophage activation and polarization were mediated by TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways. The observed results were independent of lipopolysaccharide contamination. Our study provides a new insight into a mechanism by which MBP enhances immune responses and warrants the potential application of MBP as an immune adjuvant in immune therapies.","3978":"Three-dimensional graphene aerogel-supported Fe3O4 nanoparticles for efficient detection of NO2 at room temperature are reported. The graphene composite exhibits an interconnected macroporous framework of graphene sheets with uniform dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Such a hybrid nanostructure would effectively facilitate target gas diffusion and exhibit significantly higher response and faster recovery speed than pure reduced graphene oxide, highlighting the importance of the 3D macropores and high specific surface area of the graphene aerogel support for improving sensing performance. We also propose a hybrid sensing mechanism for the drastic improvement in the sensing behavior which combines the resistance modulation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles\/graphene heterointerfaces in addition to the radial modulation of the surface depletion layer of the Fe3O4 nanocomposite.","5435":"Electrocoagulation is an electrochemical method based on the in situ generation of coagulating agents by sacrifical anodes use. In this paper we aimed to study the adsorption process kinetics of two dyes with multiple industrial uses, namely, Indigo Carmine and Alizarin Saphirol Also, the influence of current density and initial pH value on adsorption process kinetics was evaluated. The results revealed that on aluminum anodes, the highest adsorption process rates and the lowest half- time values were obtained at pH = 6. In the case of iron anodes use, we have noticed that the half-time decreased with increasing pH and the initial adsorption rate values increase with pH increasing.","2210":"Drug delivery carriers stabilize drugs and control their release, expanding the therapeutic window, and avoiding side effects of otherwise freely diffusing drugs in the human body. Materials used as carrier vehicles have to be biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic, and nonimmunogenic. Previously, particles made of the recombinant spider silk protein eADF4(C16) could be effectively loaded with positively and neutrally charged model substances. Here, a new positively charged variant thereof, named eADF4(16), has been engineered. Its particle formation is indistinguishable to that of polyanionic eADF4(C16), but in contrast polycationic eADF4(16) allows incorporation of negatively charged substances. Both high-molecular-weight substances, such as nucleic acids, and low-molecular-weight substances could be efficiently loaded onto eADF4(16) particles, and release of nucleic acids was shown to be well controlled.

In this study, eco-friendly superabsorbent materials were prepared from a mixture of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a raw material and different concentrations of citric acid (CA) as a crosslinking agent through electron beam irradiation (EBI). The results showed that theCMC\/2 wt% CAandCMC\/4 wt% CA samples obtained using 20-kGy EBI showed the highest gel fraction value of over 95 % and the highest swelling degree of around 7,000 %. In addition, the water retention of the swollenCMC\/2 wt% CA gel decreased steadily to around 63 % of the initial absorbed water during a period of 7 h, and then remained at around 60 %.","6100":"Recently, a unique dynamic magnetic field was developed to induce the rotational movement of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. This technique has been applied to remotely control both cellular internalization and apoptosis. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how a lipid membrane responds to the introduction of rotating NPs is quite important to promote the applications of this technique in a variety of biomedical area. Here, we performed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations to systematically investigate the interaction mechanism between lipid membranes and rotating NPs. Two kinds of membrane responses are observed. One is the promoted cell uptake and the other is the mechanical membrane rupture. The promoting effect of NP rotation on the cell uptake is ascribed to the enhanced membrane monolayer protrusion, which can wrap the NP from the top side. Meanwhile, the rotating NP exerts a shearing force on the membrane. Accordingly, the membrane undergoes a local distortion around the NP. If the shearing force exceeds a critical value, the local membrane distortion develops into a mechanical rupture. A number of factors, like NP size, NP shape, ligand density and rotation speed, are critical in both of the above membrane responses.","2627":"In this article series of nanocrystalline Sm-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with various molar concentration of samarium were synthesized by modified ultrasonic assisted sol-gel method and calcined at 500 degrees C for 2 h. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized in details using XRD, TEM, XPS UV-vis DRS and BET analysis. The detailed photocatalytic activity results revealed that doped samples shows excellent photodegradation efficiency towards model pollutant Alizarin red-S (AIRS) and almost 93% dye degrades within 120 minutes. The highest photodegradation efficiency was noticed for 1mole % samarium doped sample at 50 mgL(-1) of catalyst dose. The photocatalytic activity of synthesized nanoparticles were also compared with commercially available ZnO and (Degussa, P-25) photocatalyst. It was found that synthesized nanomaterials showed enhanced photocatalytic efficiency than commercially available semiconducting photocatalyst.","7309":"We study the fully nonlinear, nonlocal dynamics of two-dimensional vesicles in a time-dependent, incompressible viscous flow at finite temperature. We focus on a transient instability that can be observed when the direction of applied flow is suddenly reversed, which induces compressive forces on the vesicle interface, and small-scale interface perturbations known as wrinkles develop. These wrinkles are driven by regions of negative elastic tension on the membrane. Using a stochastic immersed boundary method with a biophysically motivated choice of thermal fluctuations, we investigate the wrinkling dynamics numerically. Different from deterministic wrinkling dynamics, thermal fluctuations lead to symmetry-breaking wrinkling patterns by exciting higher order modes. This leads to more rapid and more realistic wrinkling dynamics. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data by Kantsler et al. [Kantsler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 99, 17802]. We compare the nonlinear simulation results with perturbation theory, modified to account for thermal fluctuations. The strength of the applied flow strongly influences the most unstable wavelength characterizing the wrinkles, and there are significant differences between the results from perturbation theory and the fully nonlinear simulations, which suggests that the perturbation theory misses important nonlinear interactions. Strikingly, we find that thermal fluctuations actually have the ability to attenuate variability of the characteristic wavelength of wrinkling by exciting a wider range of modes than the deterministic case, which makes the evolution less constrained and enables the most unstable wavelength to emerge more readily. We further find that thermal noise helps prevent the vesicle from rotating if it is misaligned with the direction of the applied extensional flow.","4417":"Graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) is an exciting material - a semiconductor comprised only of carbon and nitrogen. It is very easy to synthesize and there are many papers on the development of this material in key energy applications such as photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. As a promising candidate for sustainable photocathodes, g-CN has advantages such as low cost, visible light sensitivity and high chemical stability. However, to date, the performance of g-CN has been limited, partly because standard synthesis methods produce relatively dense materials with low surface area. To combat this, there are now many examples of hard and soft templating to change the structure and morphology of g-CN and introduce porosity. This review will discuss the key advances and challenges in this interesting new field.","5602":"Isomerization and transformation of glucose and fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in both ionic liquids (ILs) and water has been studied by the reference interaction site model self-consistent field spatial electron density distribution (RISM-SCF-SEDD) method coupled with ab initio electronic structure theory, namely coupled cluster single, double, and perturbative triple excitation (CCSD(T)). Glucose isomerization to fructose has been investigated via cyclic and open chain mechanisms. In water, the calculations support the cyclic mechanism of glucose isomerization; with the predicted activation free energy is 23.8 kcalmol(-1) at experimental condition. Conversely, open ring mechanism is more favorable in ILs with the energy barrier is 32.4 kcalmol(-1). Moreover, the transformation of fructose into HMF via cyclic mechanism is reasonable; the calculated activation barriers are 16.0 and 21.5 kcalmol(-1) in aqueous and ILs solutions, respectively. The solvent effects of ILs could be explained by the decomposition of free energies and radial distribution functions of solute-solvent that are produced by RISM-SCF-SEDD.

A combination of carbon nanomaterials and hydroxyapatite (HAP) with polysaccharides holds a great potential in bone tissue engineering. In the present study, new porous tricomponent scaffolds, graphene oxide (GO)-gellan-HAP, GO-alginate-HAP and GO-amylopectin-HAP were prepared by freeze drying method. The ionic interactions between the individual components in the formation of the composites were confirmed by FTIR and XRD. The porous morphology of scaffolds was confirmed by FE-SEM images. Osteoconductivity and biocompatibility of scaffolds on MG 63 cell line were confirmed by in vitro MTT assay. The increased mineralization could be visualized by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Among the scaffolds, the GO-amylopectin-HAP exhibited higher biocompatibility, mineralization and cell attachment. The compressive strength values were determined and found to be 466.8 +\/- 19 for GO-gellan-HAP, 171 +\/- 17 for GO-alginate-HAP and 161 +\/- 4 for GO-amylopectin-HAP scaffolds. The higher biocompatibility, mineralization and cell attachment and lower compressive strength for GO-amylopectin-HAP was attributed to higher pore size and porosity. These results indicated that the prepared tricomponent scaffolds could be used as promising biomaterials in tissue engineering.","518":"Hydrogen from direct splitting of water molecules using photons is reckoned to be a sustainable and renewable energy solution for the post fossil-fuel era. Efficient photocatalysts, including metal-free photocatalysts, are key determinants of cost-effective hydrogen generation at a large-scale. The search for new materials that are metal-free is therefore ongoing. Recently, 2D phosphorene, a phosphorus analogue of graphene, has been added as a new semiconductor to the family of monolayer-flatland materials. In this review, we focus on analysing the fundamental electronic, optical and chemical properties of 2D phosphorene and assess its suitability as a metal-free water splitting photocatalyst. We also critically analyse its stability against claims from environmental antagonists and attempt to predict its future as a photocatalyst. This review provides timely information for researchers, scientists and professionals devoted to materials research for photocatalysis.","2586":"The control in surface hydrophobicity and water adhesion is extremely important for various applications in water harvesting, oil\/water separation membrane, energy systems or biosensing, for example. Here, for the first time we show that the use of fluorescent monomers such as pyrene with various substituents differing by their hydrophobicity, size, or rigidity\/flexibility can lead to surfaces with tunable hydrophobicity, water adhesion and fluorescence properties by a direct electropolymerization process. Seven original monomers with fluoroalkyl, alkyl, phenyl, adamantyl, and triethylene glycol substituents were synthesized and studied. The surface roughness is highly dependent on the substituent, and it seems that the fluorescence, although complex, correlates with the surface roughness. Superhydrophobic properties and highly oleophobic properties are obtained using fluoroalkyl chains due to the presence of nanostructured microparticles. In comparison to the structured absorption and emission bands of pyrene monomers, the pyrene polymers (oligomers) exhibit a broad structureless spectral shape both in absorption and in emission, which seems to be due to pyrene oligomerization and aggregation. This work is a first tentative attempt to combine superhydrophobic and fluorescent properties using an innovative strategy and opens new doors to explore in this domain.","5004":"Amorphous Cu-added tin oxides\/carbon nanofiber (Cu-added SnOx\/CNFs) composite webs used for lithium-ion battery anode materials are prepared by an electrospinning technique and subsequent thermal treatment. The Cu-doped SnOx particles are uniformly distributed in the CNFs and maintain the original morphology after long-term cycling. In a controlled experiment, SnOx-20%Cu\/CNFs with an atomic ratio of Cu : Sn = 0.2 shows the highest electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 743 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and an excellent rate capacity of 347 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1). Moreover, the composite electrode exhibits an outstanding long-term cycling performance at 2 A g(-1) even after 1000 cycles. The superior reversible lithium-ion storage capability is attributed to the uniform dispersion of the Cu2O and ultrafine SnOx particles in CNFs as well as the Cu-addition effects such as promoting electron transport and Li+ diffusion, preventing Sn from aggregation during cycling, and improving the reversibility of Sn back to SnOx in the recharge process.","7310":"Since its invention more than six decades ago, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has evolved as an inevitable part of chemical as well as structural analysis of small molecules, polymers, biomaterials and hybrid materials. In the solution state, due to the increased viscosity of complex viscoelastic fluids such as gels, liquid crystals and other soft materials, the rate of molecular tumbling is reduced, which in turn affects the chemical shift anisotropy, dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. As a consequence the solution state NMR spectra show broad lines, and therefore, extracting detailed structural information is a challenging task. In this context, solid state (SS) NMR has the ability to distinguish between a minute amount of polymorphic forms, conformational changes, and the number of non-equivalent molecules in an asymmetric unit of a crystal lattice, and to provide both qualitative as well as quantitative analytical data with a short-range order. Therefore, SS NMR has continued to evolve as an indispensable tool for structural analysis and gave birth to a new field called NMR crystallography. Solid state cross polarization (CP) and high resolution (HR) magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy has been used to study weak interactions in polymer gels. However, the application of SS NMR spectroscopy to study gels derived from low molecular weight gelators has been limited until recently. In this review, we will focus on the importance of solid state NMR spectroscopy in understanding and elucidating the structure of supramolecular gels derived from low molecular weight gelators with selected examples.","4959":"We report a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.4% at 100 mW cm(-2), which is one of the highest values for N719-based, solid-state, dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs). Our solar cells are based on one-dimensional (1D) hierarchical hetero-nanotubes consisting of Au cores and SnO2\/TiO2 nanosheet double shells (referred to as Au@SnO2@TNSs). Carbonaceous nanofibers (CNFs) with tellurium (Te) cores are used as dual templates for the inner-deposition of gold and the outer-deposition of the metal oxide layers. An organized mesoporous TiO2 (OM-T) film, with high porosity, large pores, and good interconnectivity, is also prepared via a graft copolymer template approach and utilized as a matrix to disperse the 1D hierarchical nanostructures. Such nanostructures provide good pore-filling for solid electrolytes, faster electron transfer, and enhanced light scattering, as confirmed by reflectance spectroscopy, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectroscopy, and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)\/intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS).","378":"A hybrid electrolyte for energy efficient windows was fabricated by incorporating functionalized zirconium oxide (ZrO2) nanocrystals into poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) and complexed with lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF3SO3). Ionic conductivity of the electrolyte increased by 4 orders of magnitude upon addition of a phase-pure cubic ZrO2 that was synthesized by reacting zirconium (IV) isopropoxide and benzyl alcohol at 210 degrees C for 3 days. Functionalizing the nanocrystal with a vinyl group-containing ligand, at a ligand-to-ZrO2 molar ratio of 0.1:1, enhanced the electrolyte's optical transmittance doubly while maintaining its high ionic conductivity of 1.78 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at a loading of 3.85 ZrO2 wt%. Further addition of the ligand significantly decreased the ionic conductivity but kept a high optical transmittance. This new nanocomposite electrolyte with further tuning has the potential to be next generation electrolyte for energy efficient windows. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, the electrospinning technique has attracted immense attention in the development of nanofiber-based biosensors. Electrospinning has been accepted as a proficient practice for the fabrication of polymer, metal and metal-oxide nanofibers. Electrospinning appears to be the ultimate technique to generate biocompatible and biodegradable polymer\/metal-oxide nanofibers, such as carbon, ZnO, TiO2, and NiO, for highly sensitive biosensing applications. Biosensors with enhanced sensitivity are becoming fascinating for the sensing of blood, and in particular for glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein( LDL) affinity sensing. Electrospinning can deposit a three-dimensional porous nanofibrous mat network on the surface of a sensor transducer, which provides a large global pore volume, predictable pore size distribution, and tunable interconnected porosity. These features of nanofibers can add further suitable functionalities to a sensor for the detection of bioanalytes in a specific environment, where efficient mass transport is needed towards the electrode surface. Electrospun fibers are able to form a highly porous nanofibrous web and their huge surface to volume ratios could lead to very high sensitivity due to their exceptional specific surface areas and interesting nanostructured morphologies, which give rise to properties that do not exist in fibers or wires with a bigger size. Based on the distinctive properties of electrospun nanofibers in the nanoscale that differentiate them from other nanostructures created by other existing methods, we describe in this review the knowledge on nanofibers suitable for biosensor and biomedical applications, including structure and property characterization. Additionally, information on polymers together with metal-oxides precursors and their processing conditions for the electrospinning of ultrafine metal-oxide fibers is briefly described in this paper. Additional relevant issues concerning the research challenges, technology limitations, and future trends are also discussed.","5119":"The gelation behavior of lithocholate (LC-) with different metal ions in water was investigated. The microstructures of hydrogels were determined to be three-dimensional (3D) networks of fibrous aggregates. The formation of fibrils was speculated to be mainly driven by the coordination between carboxylate of LC- and metal ions, accompanied by the assistance of noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The hydrogels, which can maintain the mechanical strength at higher temperature, exhibit thermal stability. Their gelation capability was enhanced with the increase in acidity. The hydrogels of LC- and Cu2+ mixtures served as the precursors for producing network nanostructures of CuS nanoparticles. These new CuS networks exhibit high fluorescence quenching ability and can act as an effective fluorescent sensing platform for ssDNA detection.","5389":"The usage of conformational ensembles constitutes a widespread technique for the consideration of protein flexibility in computational biology. When experimental structures are applied for this purpose, alignment techniques are usually required in dealing with structural deviations and annotation inconsistencies. Moreover, many application scenarios focus on protein ligand binding sites. Here, we introduce our new alignment algorithm ASCONA that has been specially geared to the problem of aligning multiple conformations of sequentially similar binding sites. Intense efforts have been directed to an accurate detection of highly flexible backbone deviations, multiple binding site matches within a single structure, and a reliable, but at the same time highly efficient, search algorithm. In contrast, most available alignment methods rather target other issues, e.g., the global alignment of distantly related proteins that share structurally conserved regions. For conformational ensembles, this might not only result in an overhead of computation time but could also affect the achieved accuracy, especially for more complicated cases as highly flexible proteins. ASCONA was evaluated on a test set containing 1107 structures of 65 diverse proteins. In all cases, ASCONA was able to correctly align the binding site at an average alignment computation time of 4 ms per target. Furthermore, no false positive matches were observed when searching the same query sites in the structures of other proteins. ASCONA proved to cope with highly deviating backbone structures and to tolerate structural gaps and moderate mutation rates. ASCONA is available free of charge for academic use at http:\/\/www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de\/ascona.","199":"Lithium\/sulfur batteries are a promising candidate for energy storage as they are capable of providing higher energy density in comparison to conventional Li-ion batteries. Here a rigorous numerical model is developed to predict the capacity retention of Li\/S batteries discharged at different rates by taking into account the polysulfide (PS) shuttling effect for various nanostructured cathodes. In a numerical model, capacity fading of the cell is considered to be affected by the concentration of sulfur dissolved into the electrolyte and deposited on the anode as a Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. Our approach considers SEI layer formation as the main factor that dominates capacity fading over initial cycles (50 cycles). Equivalent Porosity (EP) is determined for various nanostructures and the model asset structures with smaller EP result in smoother capacity fading over cycling performance. The mean value of percentage error between simulation results and experimental capacity in all analyzed structures is less than 5%, except for mesoporous carbon at high discharge rates (1C). Using simulation results we propose Porous Hollow Carbon cap Nanofiber-Graphene (PHCN-G) as a highly efficient nanostructured cathode with a minimum shuttling effect and >99% capacity retention for long-cycling lifetime batteries.","7480":"Sub-micron sized alumina fibres were fabricated by electrospinning and calcination of a polymer template fibre. In the calcination step, different controlled temperature heating cycles were conducted to obtain fibres of different crystalline structures. Their biodurabilities were tested at pH 7.4 with lung airway epithelial lining fluid or serum ultrafiltrate (SUF) and at pH 4.5 with macrophage phagolysosomal simulant fluid (PSF). Potential to generate free radicals was tested in vitro. Through the variation in the soak temperature from 650 degrees C to 950 degrees C (experiments S650-S950), the heating protocol affected the morphological characteristics, crystal structure, surface area, and density of the alumina fibres while their dissolution half-times were not significantly affected in SUF or PSF. Fibre samples formed at different heating ramp rates (experiments R93-R600) showed significant variation in the dissolution rates with the highest ramp rate corresponding to the highest dissolution rate. Thus, by increasing the calcination temperature ramp rate the alumina fibres may be produced that have reduced biodurability and lower inflammogenic potential. The fibres with the highest dissolution rated had the least aluminium content. The solubility half-times of the alumina fibres were shortest for fibres calcined at the fastest temperature ramp rate (though soak temperature did not have an effect). The ramp rates also affected the aluminium content of the fibres suggesting that the content may affect the structural strength of the fibres and control the dissolution.","5681":"Conducting filler composite hydrogels were prepared by first dispersing vapour grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNF) in a dispersion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), followed by mixing with a gellan gum (GG) solution prior to cross-linking with CaCl2. The gel transition temperature of GG was largely unaffected by the inclusion of PEDOT:PSS and\/or VGCNFs. We demonstrate that electrical impedance spectroscopy coupled with percolation analysis can be used to identify the water content threshold at which the electrical behaviour of hydrogels becomes dominated by conducting fillers (rather then the cationic cross-linkers). These studies suggested that the electrical behaviour transfers from dominated by Ca2+ cross-liners to dominated by electrons (from the conducting fillers) at a water content of 87.2 +\/- 1.2%. The composite hydrogels exhibited conductivity values of up to 107 +\/- 6 mS\/cm for gels containing 81% water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Linear superposition and switching polarity of current and voltage tests were validated by the authentic piezoelectric output. Nanofiber (NF)-based devices with a length similar to 5 cm can be easily attached on the human finger under folding-releasing at similar to 45 degrees, and the output voltage and current can reach 0.8 V and 30 nA, respectively.

In addition, the acidic environment in the tissue of stroke victims necessitates drug release upon pH stimuli. Here, we report the encapsulation of single neural stem cells (NSCs) using a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique with polyelectrolytes gelatin and alginate. Analysis of the NSCs showed that the LbL encapsulation would not affect the viability, proliferation, or differentiation of the cells. When insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was loaded on the coating material alginate, its release from alginate into the medium presented in a time-dependent and pH-dependent way. IGF-1 significantly enhanced the proliferation of the encapsulated NSCs, demonstrating a drug-carrier function of the LbL single-cell nanocoating. It provided a potential treatment strategy for nervous system disorders such as stroke.","7227":"This study investigated the effect of fat content (3.5; 1.5 and 0.1 % w\/w), together with total solids content on selected rheological and sensorial characteristics of yoghurt samples fermented with exopolysaccharides producing lactic acid bacteria (Streptococcus termophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus). Rheological flow and oscillatory tests showed that all tested yoghurt samples behave like thixotropic fluids. Pronounced hysteresis areas were obtained for skimmed yoghurts with added solids (skim milk powder and lactose, 2 and 3% w\/v). Higher levels of fat favored the flow properties of the yogurt samples, enabling the formation of more stable viscoelastic gel networks. Sensorial characteristics were highly appreciated for samples with higher fat content.","3731":"Here, we bind the sodium dependent amino acid transporter on nitrilotriacetic acid\/polyethylene glycol functionalized gold sensors in detergents and perform a detergent-lipid exchange with phosphatidylcholine.

An experimental investigation firstly was carried out and then an ANN model was developed based on the experimental data. In the experimental investigation, Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis L) and Oriental spruce (Picea orientalis (L.) Link.) samples bonded with polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive were pressed at four different temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80 degrees C) for four different durations (2, 8, 14 and 20 min). The experimental results showed that higher values of bonding strength were obtained when high temperatures were combined with short pressing duration. Similar findings could be also obtained with longer pressing time for lower temperatures. The first case may be recommended to increase the efficiency of the production process, allowing a greater quantity of production per unit time. The ANN results showed a good agreement with the experimental results. It was shown that prediction error was within acceptable limits. The results revealed that the developed ANN model is capable of giving adequate prediction for bonding strength with an acceptable accuracy level. The desired outputs of bonding strength can be thus obtained by conducting less number of time-consuming and costly experimental investigations using the proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Alignment along the ridge structures is a consequence of favorable hydrophobic interactions occurring between the long alkyl chains in the DAs and the lipid-rich, sebaceous latent fingermarks. UV irradiation of the DA magnetite composite immobilized on the latent fingerprint results in the generation of blue colored PDAs. Heat treatment of the blue-colored image promotes a blue-to-red transition as well as fluorescence turn-on. A combination of the aligned pale brown colored monomeric state, UV irradiation generated blue-colored PDA state, as well as the heat treatment generated red-colored and fluorescent PDA state enables efficient visual imaging of a latent fingerprint, which is deposited on various colored solid surfaces.","5744":"Electrospun microfibers (MFs) composed of pH and temperature responsive polymers can be used for controllable and variable delivery of ibuprofen. First, electrospinning technique was employed to prepare poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (pNIPAM-co-MAA) MFs containing ibuprofen. It was found that drug release rates from PCL MFs cannot be significantly varied by either temperature (22-40 degrees C) or pH values (1.7-7.4). In contrast, the ibuprofen (IP) diffusion rates from pNIPAM-co-MAA MFs were very sensitive to changes in both temperature and pH. The IP release from pNIPAM-co-MAAMFs was highly linear and controllable when the temperature was above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of pNIPAM-co-MAA (33 degrees C) and the pH was lower than the pK(a). of carboxylic acids (pH 2). At room temperature, however, the release rate was dramatically increased by nearly ten times compared to that at higher temperature and lower pH. Such a unique and controllable drug delivery system could be naturally envisioned to find many practical applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences such as programmable transdermal drug delivery.","6169":"We present a simple method for the multiplexed formation of droplet interface bilayers (DIBs) using a mechanically operated linear acrylic chamber array.

After bubbling CO2 into the detection solution, a remarkable color change and fluorescence enhancement could be observed. A porous film was successfully fabricated by mixing TPE-ONa with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose in water, which can serve as an efficient CO2 gas detection system. More importantly, TPE-ONa exhibits low cytotoxicity towards live cells and has the ability to monitor the external CO2 concentration changes of living cells.","3567":"Recent developments in the field of energy storage materials are expected to provide sustainable solutions to the problems related to energy density and storage. The increasing energy demand for next generation portable and miniaturized electronic devices has sparked intensive interest to explore micro-scale and lightweight energy storage devices. This critical review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art recent research advances in micro-scale energy storage devices for supercapacitors (SCs), as well as their future importance in technology. Much effort has been devoted to fabricate high performance, ultrathin, planar, solid state and flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with aesthetic appeal. Nano-materials for MSCs, their fabrication techniques and performances are critically analyzed. The technical challenges and perspectives for MSCs are also discussed. The review concludes with few suggestions for future advancements in this area.","4101":"Recently, PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 micron or less) has become a major health hazard from the polluted air in many cities in China. The regular gauze masks are used to prevent inhaling the PM2.5 fine particles; however, those masks are not able to filter out the PM2.5 because of the large porosity of the mask materials. Some well-prevented masks usually have poor breathability, which increases other health risks. In this study, a polysulfone based nanofiber for mask filtration material was synthesized by electrospinning. That nanofiber mask material was characterized by SEM, air permeability test, and PM2.5 trapping experiment. The results indicate that nanofiber mask material can efficiently filter out the PM2.5 particles and simultaneously preserve a good breathability. We attribute such improvement to the nanoscaled fibers, having the same porosity as that of regular gauze mask but with extremely reduced local interfiber space.","1882":"Herein, mesoporous sodium vanadium phosphate nanoparticles with highly sp(2)-coordinated carbon coatings (meso-Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C) were successfully synthesized as efficient cathode material for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries by using ascorbic acid as both the reductant and carbon source, followed by calcination at 750 degrees C in an argon atmosphere. Their crystalline structure, morphology, surface area, chemical composition, carbon nature and amount were systematically explored. Following electrochemical measurements, the resultant meso-Na3V2(PO4)(3)\/C not only delivered good reversible capacity (98mAhg(-1) at 0.1Ag(-1)) and superior rate capability (63mAhg(-1) at 1Ag(-1)) but also exhibited comparable cycling performance (capacity retention: approximate to 74% at 450 cycles at 0.4Ag(-1)). Moreover, the symmetrical sodium-ion full cell with excellent reversibility and cycling stability was also achieved (capacity retention: 92.2% at 0.1Ag(-1) with 99.5% coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles). These attributes are ascribed to the distinctive mesostructure for facile sodium-ion insertion\/extraction and their continuous sp(2)-coordinated carbon coatings, which facilitate electronic conduction.","6850":"We demonstrate the design and fabrication of hierarchical Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets vertically grown on a porous carbon nanofiber\/MnO2 composite (CF\/MnO2) to form three dimensional interconnected networks via a facile hydrothermal process for supercapacitor applications. The obtained CF\/MnO2\/Ni(OH)(2) electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (2079 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution), rendering its promising application as a potential electrode for supercapacitors. In order to increase the energy density, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has been successfully fabricated using CF\/MnO2\/Ni(OH)(2) as the positive electrode and CFs as the negative electrode. The as-fabricated all-solid-state ASC device achieves a maximum energy density of 67.6 W h kg(-1), highly comparable with the previously reported Ni(OH)(2)-based ASCs. The present hierarchical CF\/MnO2\/Ni(OH)(2) ternary hybrid brings new opportunities to design and develop high-performance electrode materials for next-generation supercapacitors in flexible electronics.","2412":"Adsorptive nonwoven substrates are composite media that contain adsorbent materials within their fibrous structure; the methods to incorporate adsorbents in nonwoven webs determine their adsorption capacity. The key objective for hybridization is to immobilize the adsorbent while controlling the packing density and pressure drop of the composite media. Loading percentage of adsorbents, the accessible portion of their surface area, their attachment and stability within the structure, and time\/cost\/process to incorporate them is different for each hybridization technique. The general limitations associated with hybrid adsorptive nonwovens are summarized as surface area loss, process control, and production time\/cost. The primary focus of this review is on hybridization techniques that incorporate activated carbons and\/or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in nonwoven structures, used in gas filtration. It was concluded that coating, thermal bonding, lamination, and coform methods have higher throughputs compared to electrospinning. In addition, coform method provides better control over accessible surface area of adsorbents.","2577":"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) plays an important role in bone and cartilage formation and is of interest in regenerative medicine. Heparin can interact electrostatically with BMP-2 and thus has been explored for controlled release and potential stabilization of this growth factor in vivo. However, in its natively sulfated state, heparin has potent anticoagulant properties that may limit its use. Desulfation reduces anticoagulant properties, but may impact heparin's ability to interact and protect BMP-2 from denaturation. The goal of this study was to characterize three selectively desulfated heparin species (N-desulfated (Hep(-N)), 6-O,N-desulfated (Hep(-N),(-6O)), and completely desulfated heparin (Hep(-)) and determine if the sulfation level of heparin affected the level of BMP-2 bioactivity after heat treatment at 65 degrees C. BMP-2 bioactivity was evaluated using the established C2C12 cell assay. The resulting alkaline phosphatase activity data demonstrated that native heparin maintained a significant amount of BMP-2 bioactivity and the effect appeared to be heparin concentration dependent. Although all three had the same molecular charge as determined by zeta potential measurements, desulfated heparin derivatives Hep(-N) and Hep(-N),(-6O)) were not as effective as native heparin in maintaining BMP-2 bioactivity (only similar to 35% of original activity remained in both cases). These findings can be used to better select desulfated heparin species that exhibit low anticoagulant activity while extending the half-life of BMP-2 in solution and in delivery systems.","1566":"One-dimensional nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures (1-D NCNSs) have emerged in the past two decades as exceptionally promising nanomaterials due to their unique physical and chemical properties which enable a broad range of applications in various fields of modern technology. Recent investigations revealed that the 1-D NCNS-based materials can have a profound impact on energy conversion and storage, catalysis and electrocatalysis, sensors, electronic nanodevices, environmental protection, and biology-related applications. The aim of the present review article was to provide a comprehensive overview of scientific progress in 1-D NCNSs such as N-containing carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, e.g., single-walled (SWNCNTs), double-walled (DWNCNTs), and multiwalled NCNTs (MWNCNTs)), nanofibers (NCNFs), nanowires (NCNWs), nanorods (NCNRs), and nanohorns (NCNHs), and evaluate their future perspective. Various methods of preparation of 1D NCNSs and their composites are summarized and discussed. The structure-properties relations of 1-D NCNSs, based on the theoretical approach and numerous relevant physico-chemical methods of characterization, were outlined. The emphasis is given to the properties of 1-D NCNSs rendered by nitrogen incorporation into the carbon matrix in order to provide deeper insight into the specific characteristics which determine materials' performances within the specific fields of applications.

The properties of products as-prepared and annealed under atmospheric air conditions and vacuum were studied by Raman and IR spectroscopy, SEM, HRTEM, XRD, EDX, and magnetic analysis. The results show that numerous Co-containing agglomerates of chitosan derivatives are formed on the surface of one-dimensional nanostructures when chitosan added to the reaction system with CoTiO3 powder. An average cobalt concentration in surface formations is about 6.3 wt.% that is noticeably higher than in the body of layered structures. Magnetization measurements show a paramagnetic behavior for as-prepared products. After vacuum treatment at 600 degrees C and higher, the same nanostructures demonstrate the abnormal high ferromagnetic properties. Effect of chitosan as the organic reagent on texture, morphology, phase composition, and surface modification of nanostructured material is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The method was simple, facile, but highly efficient and versatile. The obtained CDs\/PNIPAM hybrid hydrogel was thought to combine through hydrogen bond assisted with spatial network embedding. Compared with the original CDs solution, the CDs\/PNIPAM hybrid hydrogel showed temperature9sensitivity as well as strong fluorescence with a LCST of 33 degrees C. Around the LCST, a slight change of temperature affected the fluorescent intensity dramatically. For example, when the temperature increased from 32 degrees C to 33 degrees C, the fluorescence intensity of CDs\/NIPAM dropped sharply with a ratio of F-32 to F-33 as high as 3.5. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity recovered when the temperature fell. Through heating and cooling cycles, the fluorescence off9on phenomenon of the CDs\/ PNIPAM hybrid hydrogel was reversible and repeatable around the LCST region.","601":"Zein is a class of alcohol-soluble prolamine proteins present in maize endosperm, which was approved as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) excipient in 1985 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) for film coating of pharmaceuticals, e.g., tablets. Despite its long-term application in tablet production, effects of zein coating on tablet properties are still not fully understood. Moreover, many studies have also been conducted to illustrate its potential as an active ingredient of direct compressed tablets and film-based delivery carriers. In addition, the use of zein as a functional film coating material for new biomedical applications was also widely investigated in recent reports, which involved medical devices, nanoparticles, quantum dots and nanofibers. In this review, the present status of zein in the form of a thin film and uniform layer for use as a biomedical material is discussed. In addition, studies related to the behaviors and properties of zein films are also summarized and analyzed based on published works to gain mechanistic insights into the relationship between zein film and various improved profiles. This review will benefit future prospects of the use of zein film in drug delivery and biomedical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, embolization and blocking of blood vessels nourishing a tumor mass evokes an angiogenic response due to the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which results in the formation of new blood vessels and eventually limitation in therapeutic efficacy. The presented work investigates the feasibility of loading the clinically used embolic beads (DC Bead (R)) with Bevacizumab (BEV), an anti-VEGF antibody, and control its release kinetics via Layer-by-Layer (LbL) coating. This strategy has the aim to achieve high, localized and sustained concentrations of BEV at the tumor site and reduce drug exposure in the systemic circulation. High loading of BEV on lyophilized beads of about 76 mg BEV\/bead vial was achieved. LbL coating was carried out by depositing alternating layers of the biocompatible polymers alginate and poly-L-lysine. Coating was proven successful by monitoring the reversal of zeta potential after addition of each layer. Morphological changes of the bead surface before and after coating were illustrated using SEM imaging. Moreover, release profiles from different formulations were studied and results showed that optimizing the number of deposited layers effectively slows the release of BEV for three days. Activity of released BEV was studied in different 2D and 3D cell based assays. Released BEV fractions showed comparable activity to fresh BEV solution used as control after 3 days. In conclusion, our results suggest the opportunity for loading anti-VEGF antibodies on commercially available embolic beads to increase the efficacy of TACE of hypervascular tumors.

Various protein-based nanoparticles with good biocompatibility have been developed for chemotherapy drug delivery in hope of reducing drugs' side effects. Sericin, a natural protein from silk, has no immunogenicity and possesses diverse bioactivities that have prompted sericin's application studies. However, the potential of sericin as a multifunctional nanoscale vehicle for cancer therapy have not been fully explored. Here we report the successful fabrication and characterization of folate-conjugated sericin nanoparticles with cancer targeting capability for pH-responsive release of doxorubicin (these nanoparticles are termed \"FA-SND\"). DOX is covalently linked to sericin \"through pH-sensitive hydrazone bonds that render a pH-triggered release property. The hydrophobicity of DOX and the hydrophilicity of sericin promote the self-assembly of sericin-DOX (SND) nanoconjugates. Mate (FA) is then covalently grafted to SND nanoconjugates as a binding unit for actively targeting cancer cells that overexpress folate receptors. Our characterization study shows that FA-SND nanoparticles exhibit negative surface charges that would reduce nonspecific clearance by circulation. These nanoparticles possess good cytotoxicity and hemocompatibiliy. Acidic environment (pH 5.0) triggers effective DOX release from FA-SND, 5-fold higher than does a neutral condition (pH 7.4). Further, FA-SND nanoparticles specifically target folate-receptor-rich KB cells, and endocytosed into lysosomes, an acidic organelle. The acidic microenvironment of lysosomes promotes a rapid release of DOX to nuclei, producing cancer specific chemo-cytotoxicity. Thus, FA-mediated cancer targeting and lysosomal-acidity promoting DOX release, two sequentially-occurring cellular events triggered by the designed components of FA-SND, form the basis for FA-SND to achieve its localized and intracellular chemo-cytotoxicity. Together, this study suggests that these FA-SND nanoparticles may be a potentially effective carrier particularly useful for delivering hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancers with high-level expression of folate receptors.","6348":"The detailed structural and mechanical properties of a tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL) bilayer were determined using neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy, small angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS, respectively), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We used MD simulations to develop a scattering density profile (SDP) model, which was then utilized to jointly refine SANS and SAXS data. In addition to commonly reported lipid bilayer structural parameters, component distributions were obtained, including the volume probability, electron density and neutron scattering length density. Of note, the distance between electron density maxima D-HH (39.4 angstrom) and the hydrocarbon chain thickness 2D(C) (29.1 angstrom) of TOCL bilayers were both found to be larger than the corresponding values for dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Conversely, TOCL bilayers have a smaller overall bilayer thickness D-B (36.7 angstrom), primarily due to their smaller headgroup volume per phosphate. SDP analysis yielded a lipid area of 129.8 angstrom(2), indicating that the cross-sectional area per oleoyl chain in TOCL bilayers (i.e., 32.5 angstrom(2)) is smaller than that for DOPC bilayers. Multiple sets of MD simulations were performed with the lipid area constrained at different values. The calculated surface tension versus lipid area resulted in a lateral area compressibility modulus K-A of 342 mN m(-1), which is slightly larger compared to DOPC bilayers. Model free comparison to experimental scattering data revealed the best simulated TOCL bilayer from which detailed molecular interactions were determined. Specifically, Na+ cations were found to interact most strongly with the glycerol hydroxyl linkage, followed by the phosphate and backbone carbonyl oxygens. Inter-and intra-lipid interactions were facilitated by hydrogen bonding between the glycerol hydroxyl and phosphate oxygen, but not with the backbone carbonyl. Finally, analysis of the intermediate scattering functions from NSE spectroscopy measurements of TOCL bilayers yielded a bending modulus K-C of 1.06 x 10(-19) J, which was larger than that observed in DOPC bilayers. Our results show the physicochemical properties of cardiolin bilayers that may be important in explaining their functionality in the inner mitochondrial membrane.","1057":"A composite membrane was fabricated from biopolymer chitosan and montmorillonite (MMT) filler as an alternative membrane electrolyte for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application. To first improve the organic-inorganic interfacial morphology, the pristine MMT was pre-treated using 3-glicidoxy propyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) surface modifier to produce organophilic MMT (O-MMT). The GPTMS modified MMT was mixed with chitosan in acetic acid solution and cast into membranes. SEM images and FTIR analysis showed that the O-MMT was successfully incorporated into the chitosan polymer matrix. Water and methanol uptake of the Ch\/O-MMT composite membranes decreased with increasing O-MMT loadings, but the ion exchange capacity (IEC) value increased. The Ch\/O-MMT with 5 wt% O-MMT loading exhibited the best methanol permeability and proton conductivity characteristics among the other Ch\/O-MMT membranes, which were 3.03 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) and 4.66 mS cm(-1), respectively. All the results obtained from this study can be used to conclude that the chitosan membrane with O-MMT filler is a promising high performance PEM candidate for DMFC application.","7425":"Mesoporous amine-functionalized magnesium ferrite nanoparticles (MgFe2O4-NH2 NPs), with maximum magnetization of around 35 emu g(-1), were successfully synthesized and simultaneously functionalized under a refluxing condition by using ethanolamine as a surface modifier. The grafting of amine groups onto the MgFe2O4 NPs was clearly confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectrum. Adopting the MgFe2O4-NH2 NPs as a magnetic nanoadsorbent for Pb2+ removal from simulated wastewater containing heavy metals is reported. Characterizations of the adsorption ability of MgFe2O4-NH2 nanoadsorbent as a function of aqueous solution pH, initial Pb2+ concentration and agitating time, as well as their adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms, were also performed. The adsorption of 25 mL of 10 mg L (1) Pb2+ initial concentration onto 25 mg of MgFe2O4-NH2 nanoadsorbent reached equilibrium within 10 min at pH 4 with 99% removal efficiency. Kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption were fitted with pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively, indicating the strong chemisorption through coordinative bond formation between the amine groups and Pb2+ ions. This MgFe2O4-NH2 nanoadsorbent possesses a maximum capacity, calculated from Langmuir equation, of around 135.1 mg g(-1), which is higher than those of typical amine-functionalized adsorbents. Also, the selectivity experiments show that the MgFe2O4-NH2 nanoadsorbent provides higher selectivity coefficient values for Pb2+ than Ca2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+.","5180":"It has been demonstrated that radiation pretreatment can cause a significant breakdown of the stubborn cellulose structure, which will increase the accessibility of cellulose and enhance enzyme hydrolysis in bio-fuel processes. In this study, using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a model substrate, the impacts of irradiation dose on the microstructure, thermal stability and irradiated-degradation components of cellulose under Co-60 gamma-irradiation (0-1400 kGy) was comprehensively investigated. FT-IR, EPR and NMR analyses show that irradiation destroys the glycosidic bond and inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bond of cellulose, resulting in the generation of reductive carbonyl groups and free radicals. SEM, XRD and GPC analyses confirm that irradiation can damage the crystalline microstructure and surface morphology of MCC, which reduces its degree of polymerization from 183 045 kDa to 4413 kDa. TGA and DGA curves indicate that the activated energy (E-a) and thermal stability of treated MCC decrease with the increasing irradiation dose. Ion chromatography (IC) analysis demonstrates that there exist fermentation sugars such as glucose (10.73 mg g(-1)), xylose (1.58 mg g(-1)), arabinose (0.46 mg g(-1)), fructose (4.31 mg g(-1)), and cellobiose (1.90 mg g(-1)) as well as low amounts of glucuronic acid (0.35 mg g(-1)) and galacturonic acid (1.46 mg g(-1)) in the irradiation-derived degradation components. Therefore, the findings in this study suggest that gamma-irradiation processing is an environment-friendly, promising and effective approach to treat lignocellulose biomass.","2495":"Biocompatible materials capable of controlled actuation under biologically relevant conditions are in high demand for use in a number of biomedical applications.

Partial alkaline hydrolysis of the oxazole ring brought ionic functional groups onto the fiber surface, enabling the disintegration of the PBO fiber into nanofibers with the help of an electrostatic repulsive force. The obtained nanofibers, whose average diameter was 24 nm, were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, zeta-potential analysis, XRD, and TGA. They dispersed homogeneously in water due to the surface charges. Filtration allowed a PBO nanofiber sheet to be easily prepared from the homogeneous dispersion in water.","4956":"Na3V2(PO4)(3) (NVP) has been considered as a very promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its typical NASICON structure, which provides an open and three dimensional (3D) framework for Na+ migration. However, the low electronic conductivity of NVP limits its rate capability and cycling ability. In this study, carbon coated hollow structured NVP\/C composites are synthesized via a template-free and scalable ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process, where the carbon coated NVP particles are uniformly decorated on the inner and outer surfaces of the porous hollow carbon spheres. When evaluated as a cathode material for SIBs, the unique NVP\/C porous hollow sphere cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 99.2 mA h g(-1) and retains 89.3 mA h g(-1) after 300 charge\/discharge cycles with a very low degradation rate of 0.035% per cycle. For comparison, the NVP\/C composite, prepared by the traditional sol-gel method, delivers a lower initial discharge capacity of 97.4 mA h g(-1) and decreases significantly to 71.5 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of NVP\/C porous hollow spheres is attributed to their unique porous, hollow and spherical structures, as well as the carbon-coating layer, which provides a high contact area between electrode\/electrolyte, high electronic conductivity, and high mechanical strength.","4174":"The combination of magnetic hyperthermia therapy with the controlled release of chemotherapeutic agents in tumors may be an efficient therapeutic with few side effects because the bioavailability, tolerance and amount of the drug can be optimized. Here, we prepared magnetoliposomes consisting of magnetite nanoparticle cores and the anticancer drug gemcitabine encapsulated by a phospholipid bilayer. The potential of these magnetoliposomes for controlled drug release and cancer treatment via hyperthermic behavior was investigated. The magnetic nanoparticle encapsulation efficiency was dependent on the initial amount of magnetite nanoparticles present at the encapsulation stage; the best formulation was 66%. We chose this formulation to characterize the physicochemical properties of the magnetoliposomes and to encapsulate gemcitabine. The mean particle size and distribution were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential was measured. The magnetoliposome formulations all had acceptable characteristics for systemic administration, with a mean size of approximately 150 nm and a polydispersity index < 0.2. The magnetoliposomes were stable in aqueous suspension for at least one week, as determined by DLS. Temperature increases due to the dissipation energy of magnetoliposome suspensions subjected to an applied alternating magnetic field (AMF) were measured at different magnetic field intensities, and the values were appropriated for cancer treatments. The drug release profile at 37 degrees C showed that 17% of the gemcitabine was released after 72 h. Drug release from magnetoliposomes exposed to an AMF for 5 min reached 70%.","6647":"Terahertz response of free standing films of bacterial cellulose and its composites with conducting polymer complex PEDOT\/PSS has been studied by terahertz time domain spectroscopy.

But the practical use of a Li-S battery is still hindered by its rapid capacity decay owing to the polysulfide dissolution. In spite of much efforts in combining sulfur with porous carbon materials to suppress the dissolution of the polysulfide, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of silica in polysulfide adsorption. Herein, an efficient strategy is applied to limit the polysulfide dissolution by using a silica coated sulfur\/vaporgrown carbon fiber composite (S\/VGCF@SiO2) as the cathode material for the Li-S battery. The as-prepared S\/VGCF@SiO2 composite exhibits better cycle stability and higher rate performance, compared with the bare S\/VGCF composite. This improved performance is mainly due to the introduction of SiO2, which can effectively inhibit the \"shuttle effect\" of polysulfide.","4860":"Self-healing conductive composites composed of hyperbranched poly(amido amine)s and carbon nanotubes with a sushi-like assembly structure were fabricated. They had excellent self-healing ability without any stimulus, and could restore structural integrity and conductivity highly efficiently with minimized intervention.","2796":"Quantifying the effect that nanofiber mat chemistry and hydrophilicity have on microorganism collection and inactivation is critical in biomedical applications. In this study, the collection and inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 was examined using cellulose nanofiber mats that were surface-functionalized using three polyelectrolytes: poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), chitosan (CS), and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (pDADMAC). The polyelectrolyte functionalized nanofiber mats retained the cylindrical morphology and average fiber diameter (-0.84 1.1.m) of the underlying cellulose nanofibers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements confirmed the presence of polycations or polyanions on the surface of the nanofiber mats. Both the control cellulose and pDADMAC-functionalized nanofiber mats exhibited a high collection of E. coli K12, which suggests that mat hydrophilicity may play a larger role than surface charge on cell collection. While the minimum concentration of polycations needed to inhibit E. coli K12 was 800 1.1.g\/mL for both CS and pDADMAC, once immobilized, pDADMAC-functionalized nanofiber mats exhibited a higher inactivation of E. coli K12, (-97%). Here, we demonstrate that the collection and inactivation of microorganisms by electrospun cellulose nanofiber mats can be tailored through a facile polyelectrolyte functionalization process.","2882":"Ophthalmic wireless microrobots are proposed for minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery. Devices in the vitreous experience nonlinear mobility as a result of the complex mechanical properties of the vitreous and its interaction with the devices. A microdevice that will minimize its interaction with the macromolecules of the vitreous (i.e., mainly hyaluronan (HA) and collagen) can be utilized for ophthalmic surgeries. Although a few studies on the interactions between the vitreous and microdevices exist, there is no literature on the influence of coatings on these interactions. This paper presents how coatings on devices affect mobility in the vitreous. Surgical catheters in the vasculature use hydrophilic polymer coatings that reduce biomolecular absorption and enhance mobility. In this work such polymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and HA coatings were utilized, and their effects on mobility in the vitreous were characterized. Hydrophilic titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating was also developed and characterized. Collagenase and hyaluronidase enzymes were coated on probes' surfaces with a view to enhancing their mobility by enzymatic digestion of the collagen and HA of the vitreous, respectively. To model the human vitreous, ex vivo porcine vitreous and collagen were used. For studying the effects of hyaluronidase, the vitreous and HA were used. The hydrophilic and enzymatic coatings were characterized by oscillatory magnetic microrheology. The statistical significance of the mean relative displacements (i.e., mobility) of the coated probes with respect to control probes was assessed. All studied hydrophilic coatings improve mobility, except for HA which decreases mobility potentially due to bonding with vitreal macromolecules. TiO2 coating improves mobility in collagen by 28.3% and in the vitreous by 15.4%. PEG and PVP coatings improve mobility in collagen by 19.4 and by 39.6%, respectively, but their improvement in the vitreous is insignificant at a 95% confidence level (CL). HA coating affects mobility by reducing it in collagen by 35.6% (statistically significant) and in the vitreous by 16.8% (insignificant change at 95% CL). The coatings cause similar effects in collagen and in the vitreous. However, the effects are lower in the vitreous, which can be due to a lower concentration of collagen in the vitreous than in the prepared collagen samples. The coatings based on enzymatic activity increase mobility (i.e., >40% after 15 min experiments in the vitreous models) more than the hydrophilic coatings based on physicochemical interactions. However, the enzymes have time-dependent effects, and they dissolve from the probe surface with time. The presented results are useful for researchers and companies developing ophthalmic devices. They also pave the way to understanding how to adjust mobility of a microdevice in a complex fluid by choice of an appropriate coating.","2029":"This research is aimed at enhancing the poor room temperature formability of heat-treatable aluminum alloy AA2024-T3, without deterioration of its post-forming properties. For this purpose, the influences of different heat-treatment conditions as well as warm forming on the single point incremental forming formability and post-forming properties of this material were investigated. Thermal pre-treatments were consisting of annealing (O-temper), solution treating and quenching (W-temper), and solution heat treating, quenching, and then cold working (T-temper). The formability results as well as forming forces of pre-heat-treated sheets were compared to those of the warm forming process results carried out using a laser-assisted single point incremental forming (LASPIF) setup. The post-forming properties of SPIF-formed parts were analyzed by hardness testing. The maximum forming angles of the blank formed under O-temper and W-temper conditions showed, respectively, 41 and 32% increases compared to the one under T-temper condition. LASPIF forming of this material at a temperature of about 360 A degrees C resulted in 41% improvement in the maximum forming angle with respect to parts formed at room temperature from the T-temper sheet. The hardness of the material reduced significantly after annealing, while SPIF parts formed from W-temper blanks and under LASPIF condition regained their hardness after natural aging. The fracture surface characteristics of the failed parts showed that voids nucleate at the interface between intermetallic particles and matrix, and a dimple rupture fracture mode was identified under all heat-treatment conditions. Under O-temper condition, due to precipitation of particles along the grain boundary, an intergranular dimple rupture was observed. Finally, Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to investigate the possible effects of the heat treatment and the deformation on the changes in the composition of intermetallic and second-phase particles, grain size, and texture.","4112":"In addition to their use as colorants in food and cosmetics, various natural dyes possess photophysical properties that could enable their use as modular building blocks for preparing eco-friendly and non-toxic chromophores. Among the natural pigments, guaiazulene holds great potential due to its unique optical and electronic properties. Thus, in order to explore and understand the properties of guaiazulene-containing chromophores, a series of 4-styrylguaiazulenes 3a-l were prepared by condensation of the C-4 methyl group of naturally-occurring guaiazulene 1 with various aromatic carboxaldehydes 2a-l. Treatment of these analogs 3a-l with a strong acid protonates the electron-rich C-3 position and reveals a reversible halochromic behavior where the optical energy gap responds predictably to the electron-donor strength and the degree of 1-conjugation. Additionally, acid-doping is accompanied by efficient fluorescence switch-on, where 3e(H+) and 3g(H+) exhibited considerably higher fluorescence quantum yields than the neutral precursor. These properties facilitated the design of a new non-erasable 3D fluorescence readout (permanent or write-once read-many, WORM) system, which is comprised of a switch-on fluorescent guaiazulene-containing chromophore 3e and a commercially available iodonium photo-acid generator (PAG) in thin polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films.","3992":"Green synthesis of NiSnO3 nanopowder was carried out via chemie douce using nickel and tin chlorides as precursors by stirring and refiuxing at 80 degrees C. The dried dark green bimetallic oxide nanoparticle was then used for preparing the sensing electrode in the form of a screen-printed electrode (SPE). The synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed for elemental, structural, and morphological characteristics using various analytical techniques. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum indicated the formation of a strong Sn-O-Ni framework, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the formation of a bimetallic oxide nanopowder of NiSnO3. The synthesized nanoparticles were studied for hydroquinone (HQ) sensing characteristics to develop a sensitive and reproducible electrochemical sensor from 1 to 9 mM concentrations in buffer. The developed sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 6.03 mu A\/mM (46.38 mu A\/mMcm(-2)). The charge transfer studies indicated a reversible and diffusion-controlled process. To the best of our knowledge, such a material, i.e., NiSnO3, has not be used for HQ sensors and is being reported for the first time.","4678":"The exploration of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is a profound challenge due to the rich sodium abundance and limited supply of lithium on earth. Here, amorphous SnO2\/graphene aerogel (a-SnO2\/GA) nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method for use as anode materials in SIBs. The designed annealing process produces crystalline SnO2\/graphene aerogel (c-SnO2\/GA) nanocomposites. For the first time, the significant effects of SnO2 crystallinity on sodium storage performance are studied in detail. Notably, a-SnO2\/GA is more effective than c-SnO2\/GA in overcoming electrode degradation from large volume changes associated with charge-discharge processes. Surprisingly, the amorphous SnO2 delivers a high specific capacity of 380.2 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g(-1), which is almost three times as much as for crystalline SnO2 (138.6 mAh g(-1)). The impressive electrochemical performance of amorphous SnO2 can be attributed to the intrinsic isotropic nature, the enhanced Na+ diffusion coefficient, and the strong interaction between amorphous SnO2 and GA. In addition, amorphous SnO2 particles with the smaller size better function to relieve the volume expansion\/shrinkage. This study provides a significant research direction aiming to increase the electrochemical performance of the anode materials used in SIBs.","1261":"In the present study, a cellulose based adsorbent, P(MB-IA)-g-MNCC was synthesized by graft co-polymerization of itaconic acid onto MNCC using EGDMA as crosslinking agent and K2S2O8 as free radical initiator. P(MB-IA)-g-MNCC was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TG and VSM. Cd(II) adsorption occurs maximum at pH 6.0. Kinetic and isotherm data were described using pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Sips isotherm model, respectively. Adsorbent dosage of 2.0 g\/L was sufficient for the complete removal of Cd(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The maximum adsorption capacity of P(MB-IA)-g-MNCC was found to be 262.27 mg\/g. Spent adsorbent was effectively regenerated using 0.1 M HCl. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Deterioration of the quality of this platform chemical limits its practical applications, especially in synthesis\/pharma areas. The model drug Ranitidine (Zantac (R)) was synthesized with only 15% yield starting from 5-HMF which was isolated and stored as an oil after a biomass conversion process. In contrast, a much higher yield of 65% was obtained by using 5-HMF isolated in crystalline state from an optimized biomass conversion process. The molecular mechanisms responsible for 5-HMF decomposition in solution were established by NMR and ESI-MS studies. A highly selective synthesis of a 5-HMF derivative from glucose was achieved using a protecting group at O(6) position.","7484":"A new technology for the production of cellulose nanofibers from vegetable food waste has been developed. The fibers are liberated enzymatically, given a functionalized coating and oriented using spinning techniques. We performed a laboratory-scale life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the various routes of the entire production process from an environmental perspective. The results indicate that the electrospinning process has a higher impact than the alternative wet spinning process under the conditions described. Furthermore, to improve the liberation process of the microfibrillated cellulose, the enzymatic treatment step requires development; this could be through optimization of energy use in the heating process, mainly by reducing heat loss and water use. A comparative LCA with the results of other published studies, using different starting materials and chemical processes to obtain nanocellulose, provides a deeper understanding of our processes. From this comparison, we conclude that our technology has the potential to become a competitive alternative, outperforming other nanocellulose technologies from an environmental perspective.","2164":"Solar-driven hydrogen evolution from water has emerged as an important methodology for the storage of renewable energy in chemical bonds. Efficient and practical clean-energy devices for electrochemical or photoelectrochemical splitting of water require the immobilization of stable and active hydrogen-evolving catalysts onto electrode or photocathode materials, which remains a significant challenge. Here we show that cobalt(II) reacts with benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrathiol in the presence of base to form a cobalt dithiolene polymer 1. The generated polymer is immobilized onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) to generate a metal organic surface (MOS 1IGCE), which displays efficient H-2-evolving activity and stability in acidic aqueous solutions. Moreover, the generated polymer is integrated with planar p-type Si to generate very efficient photocathode materials (MOS 1ISi) for solar-driven hydrogen production from water. Photocurrents up to 3.8 mA\/cm(2) at 0 V vs RHE were achieved under simulated 1 Sun illumination. MOS 1ISi photocathodes operate at potentials 550 mV more positive than MOS 1IGCE cathodes to reach the same activity for H-2 evolution from water (1 mA\/cm(2)).","2484":"This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of a series of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)-based hydrogel lenses coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains. A novel tri-branched PEG-substituted hydrazide is synthesized, which imparts densely packed, covalently bound PEG layers on hydrogels, to determine whether branching provides improved coverage of the lens surface, thereby reducing protein adsorption. Surface modification of hydrogels with PEG was performed via amide-coupling reactions between PEG-substituted hydrazide and the pHEMA matrix. Protein adsorption, water content, optical transparency, and surface properties of the hydrogels were investigated. The hydrogels exhibited transmittance of >90% and improved surface hydrophilicity. Notably, the amount of lysozyme adsorbed on tri-branched PEG-coated hydrogels decreased significantly compared to the amount adsorbed onto the surface of control and linear PEG-coated hydrogels. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which PEGs reduce lysozyme adsorption and suggest that PEG coating may offer an intriguing potential for ophthalmic biomaterials as well as protein-resistant devices.","6044":"In the present study, graft copolymerization of acrylic acid sodium salt (AAS) onto O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CMCs) produced a highly hydrophilic and pH-sensitive hydrogel polymer of O-CMCs-g-AAS with a porous surface morphology. The grafted chitosan copolymer was coated on magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) and characterized with TEM, SEM, and FT-IR techniques. The prepared nanocomposite, [O-CMCs-g-AAS]\/MGO, was successfully used as an efficient and biocompatible adsorbent in magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for preconcentration and determination of catechin in tea beverages. The influence of the main parameters affecting the quality of the coating process was investigated and optimized using a response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, the adsorbent demonstrated a satisfactory adsorption capacity (27 mg g(-1)) for catechin and good linearity in the range of 0.005-5 mu g mL(-1) with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.9987. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.001 and 0.003 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4.1% (n = 5, C = 0.5 mu g mL(-1)).","3882":"As a structural analogue of graphene, boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) have attracted ever-growing research interest in the past few years, due to their remarkably mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. The preparation of BNNS aerogels is considered to be one of the most effective approaches for their practical applications. However, it has remained a great challenge to fabricate BNNS aerogels with superelasticity by a facile method. Here, we report the preparation of BNNS aerogels via a facile method involving polymer-assisted cross-linking and freeze-casting strategies. The resulting aerogels exhibit a well-ordered and anisotropic microstructure, leading to anisotropic superelasticity, high compressive strength, and excellent energy absorption ability. The unique microstructure also endows the aerogels with ultralow dielectric constant (1.24) and loss (similar to 0.003). The successful fabrication of such fascinating materials paves the way for application of BNNSs in energy-absorbing services, catalyst carrier, and environmental remediation, etc.","6224":"The effect of continuous UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide on destruction and antioxidant properties of synthetic DOPA-melanin (prepared by oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)) and melanosomes isolated from cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was investigated. The kinetics of melanin destruction was recorded based on the accumulation of fluorescent low-molecular-weight reaction products, the antiradical activity of melanin was determined by chemiluminescence method, the concentration of free radical products was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance, and the antioxidant activity of melanins was estimated by their inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation. It was shown that UVC-UVA irradiation (up to 5 hours) of DOPA-melanin and melanosomes of retinal pigment epithelium decreased neither the latency period of luminol chemiluminescence nor the inhibitory action of pigments on Fe2+- and UV-induced peroxidation of cardiolipin liposomes. However, very long UV irradiation gave rise to fluorescent destruction products, decreased the concentration of paramagnetic centers in the pigment (especially light-dependent ones), and decreased the antiradical and antioxidant activities. For example, UV irradiation of DOPA-melanin during 52 h resulted in approximately a 2-fold decrease in the concentration of paramagnetic centers and decline of antiradical and antioxidant activities. However, even with such a hard irradiation the pigment retained significant inhibitory activity against lipid peroxidation. The oxidative destruction of DOPA-melanin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the dark resulted in complete destruction of the polymer and loss of its protective properties. It is assumed that destruction of RPE cell melanin is caused mainly by oxidative processes.","1430":"DNA self-assembly has emerged as a new paradigm for design of biomimetic membrane channels. Several experimental groups have already demonstrated assembly and insertion of DNA channels into lipid bilayer membranes; however, the structure of the channels and their conductance mechanism have remained undetermined. Here, we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations that characterized the biophysical properties of the DNA membrane channels with atomic precision. We show that, while overall remaining stable, the local structure of the channels undergoes considerable fluctuations, departing from the idealized design. The transmembrane ionic current flows both through the central pore of the channel as well as along the DNA walls and through the gaps in the DNA structure. Surprisingly, we find that the conductance of DNA channels depend on the membrane tension, making them potentially suitable for force-sensing applications. Finally, we show that electro-osmosis governs the transport of druglike molecules through the DNA channels.","1038":"Cu(II) creates complexes with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (lecithin), which are detectable using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Lecithin (L) as a relatively big ligand prevents Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I) during the electrospray process. The detected complexes include (1) dications with a general formula: [Cu(L) (n) ](2+), where n prevails from 2 to 5 (in the m\/z range from 50 to 2,000); and (2) monocations originated from the metal salt precursor [CuCl(L) (k) ](+) (k is 1 or 2). The Cu(II)\/lecithin complexes are stable enough (appearance energy higher than 200 kJ mol(-1)) to utilize Cu(II) for stabilization of an artificial membrane. The impermeability of an artificial phospholipid membrane for oxalic acid and its complexes with copper ions in slightly acidic pH 5 was confirmed voltammetrically. However, adsorption of copper-oxalate complexes on the membrane surface was proved using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. .","323":"Y2O3 functioned palygorskite (Pal) composite as a novel adsorbent has been successfully synthesized and characterized, which shows stable and rapid decolorization performance for methyl blue (MB). HRTEM images showed that Y2O3 nanoparticles with size about 2-5 nm evenly dispersed on palygorskite, and the increase of the binding energy of Y2O3 (Y3d(5\/2)) confirmed that several bonds such as Y-OH and Y-O-Si were existed in Y2O3\/Pal adsorbent. Y2O3 modification greatly increased the number of negatively charged groups as Y2O3\/Pal showed lower negative zeta potential than that of Pal. Therefore, the electrostatic interaction between Y2O3\/Pal and MB is impossible to be the adsorption mechanism. What's more, it is found that the adsorption isotherm obeys the Langmuir model, with the maximum adsorption capacity greatly enhanced to 1579.06 mg g(-1), exhibiting potential applications in wastewater treatment.","5516":"Freeze drying is a general method for preparing three dimensional (3D) graphene based materials, however, in this paper, we used N-doped graphene as a model material and found that if the N-doped graphene hydrogel was pre-frozen, instead of an interconnected porous structure, a loosely packed layered structure was obtained. Furthermore, the effects of drying conditions on the pore and chemical structure have been discussed. Results demonstrated that when the graphene hydrogel was directly freeze dried, an interconnected porous structure can be obtained, whereas, heat dried and pre-frozen samples had layered structures. The structure determines the performance; the sample prepared by direct freeze drying with an interconnected porous structure had the highest specific capacitance of 218 F g(-1) when the current density was 0.01 A g(-1), and the specific capacitance still remained at about 85% of its initial value even at a high current density (1 A g(-1)). The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the fast electrolyte diffusion paths provided by the interconnected porous channels.","5752":"Cyanobacteria, the only known prokaryotes that perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, are receiving strong attention in basic and applied research. In using solar energy, water, CO2 and mineral salts to produce a large amount of biomass for the food chain, cyanobacteria constitute the first biological barrier against the entry of toxics into the food chain. In addition, cyanobacteria have the potential for the solar-driven carbon-neutral production of biofuels. However, cyanobacteria are often challenged by toxic reactive oxygen species generated under intense illumination, i.e., when their production of photosynthetic electrons exceeds what they need for the assimilation of inorganic nutrients. Furthermore, in requiring high amounts of various metals for growth, cyanobacteria are also frequently affected by drastic changes in metal availabilities. They are often challenged by heavy metals, which are increasingly spread out in the environment through human activities, and constitute persistent pollutants because they cannot be degraded. Consequently, it is important to analyze the protection against oxidative and metal stresses in cyanobacteria because these ancient organisms have developed most of these processes, a large number of which have been conserved during evolution. This review summarizes what is known regarding these mechanisms, emphasizing on their crosstalk.","2298":"In this paper, we propose a novel method for measuring the concentration of the protein (Bovine Serum Albumin-BSA) present in bio-chemical samples. The bio-sensor exploits the inherent characteristics of the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) which is coated with a biopolymer-namely, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). For increased sensitivity, the FBG was etched with hydrofluoric acid (HF) prior to coating with the DNA. The etched FBGs are sensitive to an external analyte by evanescent field interaction. The sensing mechanism is based on the interaction of the protein with the biopolymer film, which changes the film refractive index and also exerts some stress on the underlying fiber, resulting in a shift in the Bragg wavelength. By analyzing the Bragg wavelength shift, we can calculate the amount of protein present in the sample solutions. A complete experimental analysis, based on the use of an etched and coated FBG for protein concentration measurement, is presented.","1916":"Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DXP) is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to treat acute and chronic ocular diseases. It is routinely delivered using eye-drops, where typically only 5% of the drug penetrates the corneal epithelium. The bioavailability of such ophthalmic drugs can be enhanced significantly using contact lenses incorporating drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs). The mechanism of release from chitosan NPs (CS-NPs), synthesized by ionic gelation, was studied in vitro. The DXP loaded CS-NPs were subsequently entrapped in contact lenses and the optical and drug-release properties were assessed. DXP release from CS-NPs followed diffusion and swelling controlled mechanisms, with an additional proposed impact from the electrostatic interaction between the drug and the CS-NPs. The release rate was found to increase with an increase in drug loading from 20 to 50 wt%. However, an inverse effect was observed when initial loading increased to 100 wt%. NP-laden lenses were optically clear (95-98% transmittance relative to the neat contact lens) and demonstrated sustained DXP release, with approximately 55.73% released in 22 days. The release profile indicated that drug levels were within the therapeutic requirement for anti-inflammatory use. These results suggest that these materials might be a promising candidate for the delivery of DXP and other important ophthalmic therapeutics.","7446":"2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is an important environmentally benign and sustainable chemical which can be derived from biomass and produced by the oxidization of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the oxidation of HMF relies highly on catalysts to improve the yield of FDCA. In this study, a series of novel superparamagnetic Pt nanoparticle-containing catalysts with a core-shell structure (Fe3O4@C@Pt) were synthesized and applied for HMF oxidation. These novel spherical catalysts possess a Fe3O4 core and a protective amorphous carbon shell with a surface decorated by Pt nanoparticle clusters. By changing the synthesis temperature, the morphology of the active Pt species on the carbon shell of the microspheres can be transformed from highly dispersed nanoparticles to nanoparticle clusters. The catalytic HMF oxidation results reveal that microspheres decorated with larger nanoparticle clusters (110-Fe3O4@C@Pt) have the best catalytic activity for HMF oxidation, owing to a unique islet morphology coupled with the high-degree crystallization of Pt nanoparticles. The yield of FDCA could reach 100% after 4 h of reaction at 90 degrees C in water which is superior to previous reports. Furthermore, this catalyst can be reused at least three times without significant performance loss.","5822":"Mesoporous Co3O4 rugby balls were firstly obtained by utilizing a facile two-step method.

We report on electrospun nanofibrous membranes which are composed of core-sheath structured cellulose-acetate (CA)-polyimide (PI) nanofibers. On the surface of the CA-PI fibers a fluorinated polybenzoxazine (F-PBZ) functional layer, in which silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were incorporated, has been applied. Compared with F-PBZ\/SNP modified CA fibers reported before for the separation of oil from water, the PI-core of the core-shell F-PBZ\/SNP\/CA-PI fibers makes the membranes much stronger, being a significant asset in their use. Nanofibrous membranes with a tensile strength higher than 200 MPa, a high water contact angle of 160 degrees and an extremely low oil contact angle of 0 degrees were obtained. F-PBZ\/SNP\/CA-PI membranes seemed very suitable for gravity-driven oil-water separation as fast and efficient separation (>99%) of oil from water was achieved for various oil-water mixtures. The designed core-sheath structured electrospun nanofibrous membranes may become interesting materials for the treatment of industrial oil-polluted water.","1554":"Recently breath analysis has attracted a lot of attention for disease monitoring and clinical diagnostics as spectrometric techniques of high sophistication and novel sensing materials become available. Here advances in these technologies in connection to breath analysis are critically reviewed.

Emphasis is placed on chemo-resistive gas sensors for their low cost and portability highlighting their potential and challenges for breath analysis as they start to be used in studies involving humans.","6137":"The paper reports cost analysis of house heating and preparation of hot water by means of the different heating systems. The following heating systems were analyzed: electrical heating, boilers fired with the different types of biomass (firewood, wood pellets, wood briquettes, wheat straw, sunflowers husks pellets and conventional fuels (hard coal, fine coal, natural gas, light oil fuel). Based on heat demand for house heating and preparation of hot water, properties of the fuels, current prices of the biomass, fossil fuels, electricity and boilers unit costs of heat production, operational costs and economic effect covering 15 years of exploitation were determined.","6211":"As substitutes for natural peroxidases, most nanomaterial-based enzyme mimetics (nanozymes) have unique properties such as high stability, low-cost, large surface area, and high catalytic activity. However, they usually work in acidic conditions and thus impede their real applications. In this work, by modulating the nanostructure, composition, and surface property of the bimetallic materials, the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-stabilized Au@.Ag heterogeneous nanorods.(NRs) were developed as synergistic peroxidase-like interfaces, which exhibited high activity over a wide pH range (pH 4.0-6.5) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as the chromogenic substrate. At pH 6.5, the peroxidase-like activity for the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs was stable and optimal within 20-40 degrees C. Moreover, the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs showed excellent temperature stability and long-term storage stability. Given these characters, the detection of H2O2 at pH 6.5 was proposed on the basis of the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs catalyzing the colorimetric reaction of H2O2 and ABTS, where the oxidized ABTS showed a typical absorption peak at 414 nm. The absorbance at 414 nrn was linear with H2O2 concentration from 0.01 to 10 mM. Further, considering that Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs and glucose wddase (GOx) have similar optimal pH for catalytic activities, a novel one-pot method for the detection of glucose was developed by the coupled catalytic reaction using GOx, Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs, and ABTS at nearly neutral pH (pH 6.5) and 37 degrees C. This proposed method had simple and rapid processes, wide linear range (0.05-20 mM), and reliability for the successful analysis of real samples. On the basis of these attractive and unique characteristics, Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs can become promising substitutes for peroxidase in analytical chemistry and environmental science.","5231":"Fuel cell R&D activities desirably arrive in patents; the costly maintenance fee challenges managers as well as researchers to whether or not renew existing patents. The key is, will the fuel cell patent's value be worth renewing? Thus assessment of patent value is essential. Our study focus online searching was made available after 1976, as the initial year to conduct the patent search. Up to 2001, there are 2269 patents classified in the H01M 008\/00 similar to H01M 008\/24 category, which is the category concerning fuel cell under the classification of the International Patent Classification. Effective exploitation of technology values is subject to the complementarities of organizational resources. The present study used the emerging technology of Fuel Cells as an example to show that firms may commercialize the values of technology according to their organizational resources. By aligning firms' patenting strategies and the imparities between book values and market values this study concludes a technological ambidexterity with respect to firms' technology development. The exploitative firms tend to file patents to defend their leadership in the product market as a result their technology is constrained within a firm's boundaries. The results show that patent renewing decisions are consequence of firm's constraints of complementary resources.","2680":"In spite of the recent rapid growth in stretchable electronic device research, efforts have been mainly focused on material selection, device geometric design and short-term performance characterization. The present research focuses on the long-term durability of electromechanical and electrochemical performance of buckled carbon nanotube fibers based stretchable conductors and supercapacitors under cyclic deformation. The damage mode and damage evolution as a function of fatigue deformation are identified. After 10,000 stretching-releasing cycles with mechanical deformation up to 40% strain, the conductivities of buckled dry spun and aerogel spun CNT fiber based stretchable conductors exhibit excellent stability and the resistances increase by only about 0.2% and 6%, respectively. The areal specific capacitances of buckled dry spun and aerogel spun CNT fiber based stretchable supercapacitors change, respectively, from 4.42 mF cm(-2) to 3.60 mF cm(-2), and from 8.16 mF cm(-2) to 9.95 mF cm(-2) at the scan rate of 50 mV s(-1) after 10,000 deformation cycles.

The XRD pattern indicates the polycrystalline nature of the Ladoped SnO2 nanostructure. It has been found that the La-doped SnO2 nanofibers with a rough surface are actually mesoporous tubular nanostructure. The mesoporous tubes with a diameter of similar to 200 nm possess a pore size distribution centered at about 23 nm. The La-doped SnO2 sensor shows a high response to 5 ppm ethanol. Compared to pure SnO2, the La-doped SnO2 exhibits high sensitivity and good selectivity to ethanol at a relatively low optimum operating temperature of 200 degrees C, in addition to a short response\/recovery time. The La-doped SnO2 mesoporous tubular nanostructure could be useful in fabricating semiconducting sensors for ethanol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, using graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as stabilizer, aqueous dispersions of graphene with good stability were demonstrated by directly dispersing commercialized graphene powder into water. Amazingly, 100 mg of graphene powder could be stabilized by an average of merely 7.8 mg GQDs to form aqueous dispersions with a maximum concentration of up to 0.4 mg\/mL and stability at least 3 months. The introduction of a small amount of GQDs also allowed for the fabrication of water-redispersible graphene slurry and powder, which would largely facilitate the transportation and applications of graphene. The mechanism of the GQDs stabilized graphene in water was proposed and experimentally verified through UV-visible spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. Moreover, flexible graphene papers directly assembled from the water-dispersible graphene exhibited controllable thickness, good conductivity, and acceptable strength. With properties not compromised by GQDs, water-dispersible graphene is expected to be widely applicable in electrical and electrochemical device fields.","3942":"Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata, Chuanxinlian), a medicinal herb with an extremely bitter taste that is native to China and other parts of Southeast Asia, possesses immense therapeutic value; however, its therapeutic properties have rarely been applied in the field of skin care. In this study, we investigated the effect of an A. paniculata extract (APE) on human epidermal stem cells (EpSCs), and confirmed its anti-aging effect through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo study. An MTT assay was used to determine cell proliferation. A flow cytometric analysis, with propidium iodide, was used to evaluate the cell cycle. The expression of integrin 1 (CD29), the stem cell marker, was detected with antibodies, using flow cytometry in vitro, and immunohistochemical assays in ex vivo. Type 1 collagen and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). During the clinical study, skin hydration, elasticity, wrinkling, sagging, and dermal density were evaluated before treatment and at four and eight weeks after the treatment with the test product (containing the APE) on the face. The proliferation of the EpSCs, treated with the APE, increased significantly. In the cell cycle analysis, the APE increased the G2\/M and S stages in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of integrin 1, which is related to epidermal progenitor cell expansion, was up-regulated in the APE-treated EpSCs and skin explants. In addition, the production of VEGF in the EpSCs increased significantly in response to the APE treatment. Consistent with these results, the VEGF and APE-treated EpSCs conditioned medium enhanced the Type 1 collagen production in normal human fibroblasts (NHFs). In the clinical study, the APE improved skin hydration, dermal density, wrinkling, and sagging significantly. Our findings revealed that the APE promotes a proliferation of EpSCs, through the up-regulation of the integrin 1 and VEGF expression. The VEGF might affect the collagen synthesis of NHF as a paracrine factor. Clinical studies further suggested that treatment with formulations containing APE confers anti-aging benefits. Based on these results, we suggest that APE may be introduced as a possible anti-aging agent.","5101":"A magnetic composite material composed of nano-magnetite (NMT), heulandite (HE), and cross-linked chitosan was prepared and used as an adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). The composite was characterized for the morphology, magnetic and surface properties. The optimal mass ratio of chitosan:HE:NMT for the best removal of both dyes was determined to be 1:1:0.33. The adsorption of MB and MO followed the pseudo-second order kinetics, and the maximum adsorption capacities were 45.1 and 149.2 mg g(-1) at pH 5.5, respectively. The adsorption of MB increased with the pH increase, while MO adsorption showed an opposite trend. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The as-obtained HPCNs show favorable features for electrochemical energy storage such as a high specific surface area of up to 3130 m(2) g(-1), high volume of hierarchical pores up to 1.87 cm(3) g(-1), hierarchical porosity consisting of micro, meso, and macropores, turbostratic carbon structure, controlled and tunable pore size and stable thermal and chemical properties. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a reversible specific capacitance of 240 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A gg(-1) and displays a high energy density of 77 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 875 W kg(-1). A high specific capacitance retention of 96% could be maintained even after 3000 cycles. Moreover, we used different electrolytes to study the capacitive behavior with controlled pore size. The facile, efficient and template-free synthesis strategy for novel HPCNs from polymer sources could find use in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and fuel cells.","747":"Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae et Rhizoma, known as Danshen in China, is one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines. Recently, there has been increasing scientific attention on Danshen for its remarkable bioactivities, such as promoting blood circulation, removing blood stasis, and clearing away heat. This review summarized the advances in chemical analysis of Danshen and its preparations since 2009. Representative established methods were reviewed, including spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography (LC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), capillary electrophoresis, electrochemistry, and bioanalysis. Especially the analysis of polysaccharides in Danshen was discussed for the first time. Some proposals were also put forward to benefit quality control of Danshen.","5312":"Multifunctional nanoparticles are attracting increasing attention as novel agents for efficient tumor therapy. In this study, a core-shell nanoparticle (NP) system is synthesized by growing gelatin-doxorubicin (Gel-DOX)-stabilized Prussian blue (PB) nanoshells on Fe3O4 nanocores (Fe3O4@PB@Gel-DOX NP), for combined photothermal therapy and enzyme-responsive chemotherapy under magnetic field enhancement. The composite nanoparticles exhibit excellent superparamagnetism (31.6 emu g(-1)), contributing to their enhanced therapeutic effect under the magnetic field. Drug release from this nanocomplex is triggered in the presence of enzyme in solutions or in live cells. A photothermal effect is evident under near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, owing to the high photothermal conversion efficiency of the PB nanoshell, resulting in more than 80% cell death of Hela cells treated with 40 mu g mL(-1) of the nanoparticles. The effects of combining photothermal and drug-induced tumor ablation with magnetic field enhancement are evaluated using a tumor cell viability assay in vitro. It is expected that this nanosystem integrating superparamagnetism, photothermal therapy and chemotherapy will foster new avenues for developing the next generation of multifunctional platforms towards effective cancer treatment.","798":"The interactions of an anionic redox-active dye Alizarin Red S (ARS) with novel N-hydroxyethyl-3-alkyloxypyridinium surfactants 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-(tetradecyloxy) pyridinium bromide, [HEC16OPyBr], and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-(hexadecyloxy) pyridinium bromide, [HEC16OPyBr], were investigated in an aqueous solution for the first time with an attempt to obtain comprehensive knowledge of oppositely charged dye-surfactant mixed systems. Different state-of-the-art techniques viz. conductivity, surface tension (ST), UV-visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), potentiometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and H-1-NMR analysis have been employed. The presence of ARS decreases the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of alkyloxypyridinium surfactants as the ARS monomers behave as aromatic counterions. A combined analysis of the techniques revealed the existence of cation-p, p-p stacking, H-bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions among ARS and alkyloxypyridinium surfactants. A quantitative appraisal of the process of interaction among ARS and alkyloxypyridinium surfactants has been made in terms of various micellar, binding and electrochemical parameters evaluated using ST, UV-visible and voltammetric measurements. Also, the results extracted from 1H-NMR and voltammetric measurements indicate that the catechol moiety of ARS is involved in the binding mechanism among ARS and alkyloxypyridinium surfactants.","88":"There is a high local recurrence (LR) rate in breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and enhancement of the local treatment is promising as a way to improve this. Thus we propose a drug delivery system using doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle composite nanofibers which can release anti-tumor drugs in two phases-burst release in the early stage and sustained release at a later stage-to reduce the LR of BCT. In the present study, we designed a novel composite nanofibrous scaffold to realize the efficient release of drugs by loading both DOX and DOX-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles into an electrospun PLLA nanofibrous scaffold. In vitro results demonstrated that this kind of nanomaterial can release DOX in two phases, and the results of in vivo experiments showed that this hybrid nanomaterial significantly inhibited the tumor growth in a solid tumor model. Histopathological examination demonstrated that the apoptosis of tumor cells in the treated group over a 10 week period was significant. The anticancer effects were also accompanied with decreased expression of Bcl-2 and TNF-alpha, along with up-regulation of Bax, Fas and the activation of caspase-3 levels. The present study illustrates that the mesoporous silica nanoparticle composite nanofibrous scaffold could have anti-tumor properties and could be further developed as adjuvant therapeutic protocols for the treatment of cancer.","734":"As a newly developed material system, graphene-based three-dimensional (3D) architectures have been receiving considerable attention due to their multifunctional properties. Herein, we explore the synergistic effect of combined CdS and graphene hybrids in 3D architectures and investigate their application in electrochemical energy storage. A facile hydrothermal procedure is used to prepare 3D reduced graphene oxide\/CdS (RGO\/CdS) hydrogels, and three different morphologies of CdS (ball-like, rodlike, needle-like) in the hydrogels are obtained by controlling the synthesis conditions. The results showed that the morphology of CdS significantly affects the electrochemical properties of RGO\/CdS. The electrode prepared with needle-like CdS nanoparticles exhibited the highest specific capacitor value of 300 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1), which shows outstanding cycling stability with 94% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles of charge\/discharge. These findings demonstrate the possible application of 3D RGO\/CdS architectures in energy storage.","7225":"A variety of environmental stresses like chemicals, UV and ionizing radiation and organism's endogenous processes such as replication stress and metabolism can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS\/RNS) that can attack cellular vital components like DNA, proteins and lipid membranes. Among them, much attention has been focused on DNA since DNA damage plays a role in several biological disorders and aging processes. Thus, DNA damage can be used as a biomarker in a reliable and accurate way to quantify for example radiation exposure and can indicate its possible long term effects and cancer risk. Based on the type of DNA lesions detected one can hypothesize on the most probable mechanisms involved in the formation of these lesions for example in the case of UV and ionizing radiation (e.g., X- or alpha-, gamma-rays, energetic ions, neutrons). In this review we describe the most accepted chemical pathways for DNA damage induction and the different types of DNA lesions, i.e., single, complex DNA lesions etc. that can be used as DNA damage biomarkers. We critically compare DNA damage detection methods and their limitations. In addition, we suggest the use of DNA repair gene products as biomarkes for identification of different types of stresses i.e., radiation, oxidative, or replication stress, based on bioinformatic approaches and meta-analysis of literature data.","4796":"A facile one-step synthesis strategy has been developed for producing fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from a kind of Chinese coal, Jincheng anthracite. Surface grafting of the CQDs was completed and systematically investigated by grafting with a series of organic amino molecules. It was found that the solubility and the optical properties of CQDs vary with and depend on its surface chemistry to some degree. Of organic amine-grafted coal-derived CQDs available now, ethylenediamine-grafted CQDs (EDA-CQDs) possess an obviously enhanced photoluminescence (PL) with the quantum yield (QY) as high as 18.6%, being an increase of 24.5 times in comparison with that of the pristine CQDs (0.73%), and have a capability of well dispersing within other polymer matrixes due to their good compatibility after amine-grafting. The hybrid monolith made of amine-grafted CQDs and polymer gelatin exhibits excellent PL properties even at a relatively high concentration of CQDs, indicative of great potential applications in various optical materials and devices.

The morphology, structure, and electromagnetic properties of PBC\/Fe3O4 nanocomposite were investigated. It is found that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a size of only about 5.4 +\/- 0.7 nm are highly dispersed on the surface of PBC nanofibers after surface oxidization. The PBC\/Fe3O4 nanocomposite exhibits extraordinary microwave absorption properties with a minimum reflection loss (RL) of -62.1 dB at 9.12 GHz with a thickness of 3.4 mm. Furthermore, the bandwidth of RL less than -10 dB can reach 5.92 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.5 mm. It is believed that this PBC\/Fe3O4 nanocomposite promises great potential as an ideal high-performance microwave absorption material of low cost, light weight, small thickness, high microwave absorption intensity, and wide absorption band.","2337":"The presence of metal particles, produced by rock strikes with heavy mechanical equipment, has come to be considered as evidence of fire causation in the investigation of forest fires. I report here the results of a series of experiments where direct thermographic measurements were made of the temperatures of the fragments that are created by repeatedly driving a bulldozer over rocks under extreme conditions. It is apparent, from these experimental determinations, a theoretical evaluation of the process that gives rise to them and comparison with published data, including the ignition of cellulose fuel beds by steel particles, that the minimum requirements for the ignition of kindling are not being met and that such fragments are not in fact a viable source of ignition for forest litter.","198":"The development of efficient visible-light responsive macroscopic photocatalysts is crucial for the commercialization of photocatalysis due to the difficult recovery process of photocatalyst nanoparticles. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve macroscopic photocatalysts which cannot only be successfully recycled, but also possess admirable visible-light driven photocatalytic activity. Here we report a one-step cryodesiccation route to fabricate ultra-light and recyclable C3N4\/graphene oxide (GO) aerogel. This simple and mild synthesis means that it can be carried out in various containers, which greatly extends the shape and size of C3N4\/GO aerogel. The obtained aerogel exhibits both an excellent adsorption capacity for oil, organic solvents, and dyes, and an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of dyes and the oxidation of NO at a ppb level. The successful fabrication of such a fascinating multifunctional aerogel paves the way to integrate 2D lamellar powders into 3D macroscopic photocatalysts for commercial applications in photocatalysis as well as oil remediation.","2251":"Liposomes are closed-membrane vesicles comprised of lipid bilayers, in which the inside of the vesicles is isolated from the external environment. Liposomes are therefore often used as models for biomembranes and as drug delivery carriers. However, materials encapsulated within liposomes often cannot respond to changes in the external environment. The ability of enclosed materials to maintain their responsiveness to changes in the external environment following encapsulation into liposomes would greatly expand the applicability of such systems. We hypothesize that embedding pore-like \"access points\" into the liposomal membrane could allow for the transmission of information between the internal and external liposomal environments and thus overcome this inherent limitation of conventional liposomes. To investigate this, we evaluated whether a change in the pH of an external solution could be transmitted to the inside of liposomes through the pore forming protein, yeast voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Transmission of a pH change via VDAC was evaluated using a polyglutamic acid\/doxorubicin complex (PGA\/Dox) as an internal pH sensor. Upon encapsulation into conventional liposomes, PGA\/Dox exhibits no pH sensitivity due to isolation from the external environment. On the other hand, PGA\/Dox was found to retain its pH sensitivity upon encapsulation into VDAC-reconstituted liposomes, suggesting that VDAC facilitated the transmission of information on the pH of the external environment to the inside of the liposomes. In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the transmission of information between the external and internal liposomal environments by a stable pore like structure embedded into the liposomal membranes, which serve as access points.","5163":"We report on a novel device to measure relative humidity. The sensor is based on surface diffraction gratings made of gelatin. This material swells and shrinks according to the content of water vapor in air. By sending a light beam to the grating, diffracted orders appear. Due to the gelatin swelling or shrinking, first order intensity changes according to the relative humidity. Calibration curves relating intensity versus relative humidity have been found. The fabrication process of diffraction gratings and the testing of the prototype sensing devices are described.","548":"In this work, we report the synthesis of Aliquat-336 (ionic liquid) impregnated SBA-15 mesoporous silica, showing its effective interaction and high adsorption capacity for palladium(II) ions. The physicochemical properties of the adsorbent prior to and after adsorption of palladium(II) ions were characterized extensively using FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, surface area (BET), and pore size analysis. The plausible interaction envisaged between Aliquat-336 impregnated SBA-15 and Pd(II) could be charge and ion-pair interactions. Different isotherm models were utilized to obtain the sorption parameters and the experimental data fitted adequately with the Langmuir isotherm model, with an adsorption capacity of 212.76 mg g(-1). The kinetics of the adsorption process agreed well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model, and the exothermic nature of the adsorption process was revealed through thermodynamic parameters. The Aliquat-336 impregnated SBA-15 adsorbent was regenerated using thiourea. The continuous flow studies were carried out using the Thomas model and this gave an adsorption capacity of 453.89 mg g(-1) and 376.38 mg g(-1) at flow rates of 4 and 6 mL min(-1) respectively. Furthermore, the present scheme was tested for the adsorption of palladium recovered from a spent catalyst containing 5% Pd on activated carbon.","2432":"Hydrogels have been mainly used for biomedical applications owing to their biocompatibility and high water content. However, they have serious limitations such as poor mechanical stability and fast release of the incorporated drug. To overcome these problems, we prepared collagen hydrogel (Col-H) with layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembled films (Col-H) to develop multifunctional hydrogel. We prepared LbL films using tannic acid and lignin for multi-functional properties. In addition, we incorporated doxorubicin as a model drug, which is widely used for cancer therapy. Furthermore, the prepared films exhibit antibacterial effect against gram-positive and negative bacteria and endure higher compression stress than bare Col-H.

Biomimetic otoconia are grown by double-diffusion into gelatine-gel matrices, and represent the first example of successful imitation of a biomineral, not only in outer shape but also in composite structure and hierarchical inner architecture. Biomimetic and biogenic (human) otoconia are investigated by X-ray methods, chemical analytics, ESEM, and TEM. Shape development (morphogenesis) as well as (partial) dissolution of the calcite component of the composite underline the hierarchical inner architecture built of more dense rhombohedral branches (with plane end-faces) and a rounded, more porous belly area. Atomistic simulations are performed in order to get insight into very first nucleation steps. Based on the detailed observations made up to now, first assumptions for the function of otoconia are developed, including the questions of density distribution within the volume of the specimen, the surrounding endolymph, as well as anchoring and interconnections of otoconia. A final point concerns the degeneration of otoconia which is caused by complexing agents and\/or changes in ion concentrations (and pH) of the endolymph.","4015":"Biochar has gained recent interest as a soil amendment and agent for carbon sequestration. Some biochars have significant levels of anion exchange capacity (AEC), which may reduce leaching of anionic nutrients in soil. Little is known about the nature of anion exchange sites on biochar surfaces and what production conditions promote AEC in biochar. We report that the AEC of biochars produced from four feedstocks (maize stover, cellulose, alfalfa meal, and albumin) ranged from 0.602 to 27.76 cmol kg(-1) and increased with decreasing pH (p < 0.0001) and peak pyrolysis temperature. A cellulose biochar, composed almost entirely of C, H, and O, exhibited significant AEC at pH 8 suggesting that pH independent O containing functional groups contribute AEC. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed a prominent 1590 cm(-1) band, which we attribute in part to C-O+ stretching in oxonium heterocycles. Both the C1s and O1s X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra of the biochars provide additional evidence for oxonium heterocycles. The N1s XPS spectra of albumin biochars indicated the presence of pyridinic groups. We conclude that oxonium functional groups contribute pH independent AEC and that both pyridinic functional groups and non-specific proton adsorption by condensed aromatic rings contribute pH dependent AEC to biochars.","3855":"Silicon carbide (SiC) has been considered a promising metal-free photocatalyst due to its unique photoelectrical properties and thermal\/chemical stability. However, its performance suffers from the fast recombination of charge carriers. Herein, we report mesoporous SiC nanofibers with in situ embedded graphitic carbon (SiC NFs-Cx) synthesized via a one-step carbothermal reduction between electrospun carbon nanofibers and Si powders. In the absence of a noble metal co-catalyst, the hydrogen evolution efficiency of SiC NFs-Cx is significantly improved under both simulated solar light (180.2 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1)) and visible light irradiation (31.0 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1)) in high-pH solution. The efficient simultaneous separation of charge carriers plays a critical role in the high photocatalytic activity. The embedded carbon can swiftly transfer the photogenerated electrons and improve light absorption, whereas the additional hydroxyl anions (OH-) in highpH solution can accelerate the trapping of holes. Our results demonstrate that the production of SiC NFs-Cx, which contains exclusively earth-abundant elements, scaled up, and is environmentally friendly, has great potential for practical applications. This work may provide a new pathway for designing stable, lowcost, high efficiency, and co-catalyst-free photocatalysts.","7104":"The strategy of using hybrid fillers with different geometric shapes and aspect ratios has been established to be an efficient way to achieve high-performance polymer composites. While, in spite of the recently renowned advances in this field, the mechanism of synergistic behavior in the system is still unclear and equivocal. In this study, we systematically investigated the mechanism for the synergistic reinforcement in an elastomer reinforced by nanocarbon hybrids consisting of 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The improved dispersion state of hybrid filler was attested by Raman, UV-Vis spectra and morphological observations. In addition to the phenomenological evidences, we substantiated a stronger confinement effect of hybrid network on chain dynamics, for the first time, with molecular concepts by dielectric relaxation analysis. The formation of a glassy interphase with orders of magnitude slower chain dynamics than that for bulk chains has been explicitly demonstrated in the hybrid system. Besides improved dispersion upon hybridization, it is believed the formation of a glassy interphase is another crucial factor in governing the synergistic reinforcement capability of hybrid composites. We envision this new finding provides significant insight into the mechanism of synergistic behavior in hybrid-filled polymer composites with molecular concepts.","4162":"Different reactions have been reported for the successful functionalization of carbon nanotubes (CNT). The Diels-Alder cycloaddition is recognized as a plausible chemical approach, but few reports are known where this strategy has been used. In this study, the functionalization was performed by 1,3-butadiene generated from 3-sulfolene under heating conditions in diglyme. This simple and easily scalable method resulted in functionalized CNT with mass losses of 10-23% by thermogravimetric analysis (nitrogen atmosphere). The functionalization was also supported by acid-base titration, elemental analysis, temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high content in oxygen detected on the CNT surface was assigned to anhydride formation due to a cascade oxidation of the alkene groups generated in the cycloaddition reaction. The complete evolution of the alkene leads to a grafting density of 4.2 mmol g(-1) for the anhydride moiety. Ab-initio calculations in CNT model systems indicate that the Diels-Alder addition of butadiene is a feasible process and that subsequent oxidation reactions may result in the formation of the anhydride moiety. The presence of the anhydride group is a valuable asset for grafting a multitude of complex molecules, namely through the nucleophilic addition of amines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this hybrid hydrogel, RuO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed on the exfoliated RGO sheets. The as-prepared RuO2\/RGOH electrode shows excellent supercapacitive performances with high specific capacitance (345 F g(-1) for 15% RuO2 loading), good rate capability and a long electrochemical cycling life (without decaying after 2000 cycles). Furthermore, RuO2 in the hybrid can contribute a capacitance as high as 1365 F g(-1), which is comparable to its theoretical value. These excellent results originate from the factors that the 3D porous network structure provides a more accessible surface area and facilitates an electron and proton injecting\/expelling process in the electrochemical reaction. This work provides a facile method for preparing graphene-based composite materials with remarkable capacitive performances.","4827":"Biodegradable microneedles for electrically-stimulated and tracked transdermal drug delivery were created from a nanocomposite of biocompatible, biodegradable chitosan and photoluminescent, electrically conductive graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The morphology, photoluminescent properties, cell viability and cell fluorescent imaging capability of GQDs were evaluated, showing that the nanoparticles possess low cytotoxicity and fluoresce blue under UV light, allowing for potential tracking of the drug bound onto GQDs by in vivo fluorescent imaging. The structure, crystallinity, electrical, mechanical and biodegradation properties of chitosan-GQD nanocomposites were characterised. The results show the introduction of 0.25-2 wt% GQDs into chitosan considerably improves electrical conductivity, whilst maintaining similar mechanical properties and biodegradation rate at 1 wt% GQDs. The microneedle arrays prepared from the chitosan-1 wt% GQD nanocomposite are strong enough to withstand the force of insertion into the body. The nanocomposite microneedles containing drug-laden GQDs exhibit enhanced drug release behaviour for a small molecular weight model drug compared to pristine chitosan microneedles. They also enable the release of a large molecular weight model drug through iontophoresis, which is otherwise not possible under passive diffusion conditions. These novel multifunctional nanocomposites provide a universal platform for iontophoretic and tracked delivery of both small and large molecular weight therapeutics.","6840":"Superior spectral sensitivity and functional abilities of anisotropic, instead of the usually used spherical, noble metal nanoparticles, allow development of new surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) approaches to analyse biological objects. We found and resolved for the first time the particular risks of survival of silver nanoparticles in different salines to succeed in recording the SERS spectra of intact erythrocytes as an important family of living cells. The ensemble of nanoplatelets with varied shapes and sizes grants multispectral absorption of laser irradiation since a fraction of the nanoparticles with a given position of a plasmonic band always exists in such a mixture, thereby providing an effective SERS amplification. At the same time, fast recrystallization of anisotropic silver nanoplatelets occurs in a standard chloride-based saline, being important to keep the erythrocytes alive but neglecting the benefits of the silver platelets as the most versatile and prospective components of SERS sensors. Substitution of chlorides with nitrates keeps both the intact cells and anisotropic nanoparticles safe on biocompatible cellulose SERS scaffolds containing the mixture of silver nanoplatelets thus promoting the development of new SERS devices for biomedical diagnostics.","937":"Solvent etching is a general method for the fabrication of hollow-structured nano\/micro-spheres with multiple functions. In this study, we report a facile route for the preparation of hollow composite microspheres, which are amphiphilic and superparamagnetic. In a template of magnetic composite microspheres, P(St-AA)\/Fe3O4\/PAA, P(St-AA) was selectively etched, resulting in a hydrophobic hollow structure with a shell of hydrophilic polymeric brushes. The effects of etching on the morphology, hollow structure, saturation magnetization, amphiphilic property and cytocompatibility were investigated. Characterization showed that the hollow composite microspheres obtained possessed a well-defined spherical structure, a high saturation magnetization, amphiphilic properties and good cytocompatibility, making them promising as a potential biomaterial in magnetic resonance imaging and drug delivery systems.","4310":"The polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) layer fabricated by chitosan and sodium alginate was anchored on a membrane surface though plasma treatment and layer by layer self-assembly to improve the antifouling properties of the PVDF membrane. The interface properties of modified PVDF membranes were investigated and the results indicated the presence of the PEC layer was conducive to enhance the hydrophilicity and screening ability of the PVDF ultrafiltration membrane due to the hydrophilic crosslinking structure. Furthermore, the fouling resistance including anti-adsorption ability and dynamic antifouling ability for pollutant filtration of modified PVDF membranes were significantly improved due to the anchored PEC layer. For the CS-SA-3 membrane with an assembly number of 3, the adsorption mass of BSA on the membrane surface was only 4 mu g cm(-2) and the FRR-W values increased to 89%, 99% and 98% for the three typical pollutants of bovine serum albumin, sodium alginate and humic acid, respectively. It was demonstrated that the PEC layer could be used as an antifouling material to improve the antifouling ability of hydrophobic membranes though decreasing the reversible fouling. This article also aimed to provide a simple method to fabricate the antifouling interface.","2345":"In this topical review article, we attempt to capture recent advances in the development of sustainable hybrid nanocomposite coatings for the corrosion inhibition of structural metals. Spurred primarily by the urgent imperative of replacing hexavalent chromium but also driven by concerns regarding the environmental impact of organic solvents, materials criticality considerations, the need to maintain structural integrity and function under extreme environments, and a renewed impetus towards lightweighting, the design of new coating concepts has seen an explosion of activity. We discuss varying modes of corrosion inhibition and the drive towards multicomponent nanostructured coatings that synergistically unite multiple modes of corrosion inhibition within a single coating system. Nanocomposite coatings in which nanoparticles of one phase are dispersed within a continuous phase, usually a polymeric matrix, provide a modular design approach to multifunctional coatings provided fundamental challenges such as dispersion and compatibility can be resolved. By dint of their high surface-to-volume ratios, the incorporation of nanoparticles profoundly modifies the adjacent polymeric matrix, giving rise to an 'interphase' region with modified properties, at relatively low filler loadings. The implications of incorporating metallic, porous metal oxide, and carbon nanomaterials (graphene and carbon nanotubes) within polymeric matrices are explored with an emphasis on active corrosion inhibition. The availability of high-quality nanoparticles that are either electroactive (e.g., metals, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) or are capable of serving as reservoirs for active corrosion inhibitors (e.g., porous silicon oxide, layered double hydroxides, halloysite) provides unprecedented functionality and opportunities for multifunctional coatings. The review emphasizes mechanistic considerations where these have been elucidated with a view towards developing systematic design principles for corrosion inhibition. The outlook for the future design of multimodal coatings is presented with an emphasis on the emergence of rational design of nanoparticles, advances in nanoparticle surface chemistry, high-throughput testing, materials informatics, multiscale modeling, and integrated computational materials engineering approaches.","3886":"The development of a red, chlorine-free pyrotechnic illuminant of high luminosity and spectral purity was investigated. Red-light emission based solely on transient SrOH(g) has been achieved by using either 5-amino-1H-tetrazole or hexamine to deoxidize the combustion flame of a Mg\/Sr(NO3)(2)\/Epon-binder composition and reduce the amount of both condensed and gaseous SrO, which emits undesirable orange-red light. The new formulations were found to possess high thermal onset temperatures. Avoiding chlorine in these formulations eliminates the risk of the formation of PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs. This finding, hence, will have a great impact on both military pyrotechnics and commercial firework sectors.","5364":"In recent years, a role for epigenetic modifications in the pathophysiology of disease has received significant attention. Many studies are now beginning to explore the gene-environment interactions, which may mediate early-life exposure to risk factors, such as nutritional deficiencies and later development of behavioral problems in children and adults. In this paper, we review the current literature on the role of epigenetics in the development of psychopathology, with a specific focus on the potential for epigenetic modifications to link nutrition and brain development. We propose a conceptual framework whereby epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation) mediate the link between micro- and macro-nutrient deficiency early in life and brain dysfunction (e.g., structural aberration, neurotransmitter perturbation), which has been linked to development of behavior problems later on in life.","1672":"Novel antibacterial, anti-electrostatic, and hydrophilic nanofibers based on a blend containing thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and a room-temperature ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6], were fabricated by electrospinning. We investigated the effect of the IL on the morphology and the physical properties of the TPU nanofibers. Nanofibers with a `bead-on-string' morphology were obtained by electrospinning from a neat TPU solution. The incorporation of the IL, at levels as low as 1 wt%, largely suppressed the formation of beads during electrospinning, and homogeneous nanofibers were obtained. The as-spun TPU\/IL composite nanofibers showed significant activity against both Escherichia coli (E coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), with antibacterial activities of more than four and three, respectively. This means that the antibacterial efficiencies of TPU\/IL composite nanofibers toward E coli and S. aureus are 99.99% and 99.9%, respectively. Moreover, nonwoven fabrics derived from the electrospun TPU\/IL composite nanofibers exhibit better stretchability, elasticity, and higher electrical conductivity compared to those made using neat TPU without an IL. Additionally, the incorporation of the IL leads to a hydrophilic surface for the TPU\/IL composite nanofibers compared to hydrophobic neat TPU nanofibers. These multifunctional nanofibers with excellent antibacterial, anti-electrostatic, and mechanical properties and improved hydrophilicity are promising candidates for biomedical and wastewater treatment applications.","4458":"Rationalization of the synthetic conditions allowed the predictable fast sustainable preparation of [La-2(H(3)nmp)(2)(H2O)(4)]center dot 4.5H(2)O having a 1D coordination polymer.

Plant extracts and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were individually added to patties at both 0.1% and 0.5% (w\/w) concentrations. We assessed the antioxidant efficacy of CD by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and evaluated their potential as natural antioxidants for meat preservation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values, hexanal content, fatty acid composition and color parameters. These were tested periodically during 11 days of refrigerated storage. TBARS levels were significantly lower (p 0.05) in the samples containing plant extracts or BHT than in the non-treated control. In addition, the beef patties formulated with the selected plant extracts showed significantly (p 0.05) better color stability than those without antioxidants. These results indicate that edible plant extracts are promising sources of natural antioxidants and can potentially be used as functional preservatives in meat products.","6547":"Light weight and mechanically strong alpha-chitin aerogels were fabricated using the sol-gel\/self-assembly method from alpha-chitin in different aqueous alkali hydroxide (KOH, NaOH and LiOH)\/urea solutions. All of the alpha-chitin solutions exhibited temperature-induced rapid gelation behavior. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed that the aqueous alkali hydroxide\/ urea solutions are non-derivatizing solvents for alpha-chitin. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP\/MAS) C-13 NMR confirmed that alpha-chitin has a stable aggregate structure after undergoing dissolution and regeneration. Subsequently, nanostructured alpha-chitin aerogels were fabricated by regeneration from the chitin solutions in ethanol and then freeze-drying from t-BuOH. These alpha-chitin aerogels exhibited high porosity (87% to 94%), low density (0.09 to 0.19 g\/cm(3)), high specific surface area (419 to 535 m(2)\/g) and large pore volume (2.7 to 3.8 cm(3)\/g). Moreover, the alpha-chitin aerogels exhibited good mechanical properties under compression and tension models. In vitro studies showed that mBMSCs cultured on chitin hydrogels have good biocompatibility. These nanostructured alpha-chitin aerogels may be useful for various applications, such as catalyst supports, carbon aerogel precursors and biomedical materials.","6679":"Low stability in oil media and the hydrophobicity problems of the polysulfone electrospun membranes could be overcome in the present study. Synthesis of super-hydrophilic and highly stable in oil polysulfone electrospun nanofiber membrane was achieved by electrospinning of polysulfone solution containing NaOH nanoparticles followed by activation of the dried electrospun membrane by deposition of polyamide layer on the surface using m-phenylenediamine and 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride. The introduced membrane has super-hydrophilicity characteristic (contact angle = 3 degrees), excellent stability in oil media and distinct performance in oil-water separation process.

In a bioeconomy, fossil-based commodities and electricity start to be replaced by bio-based. This is meant to address some of the so-called 'grand challenges' being faced by society, but especially energy security (by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels) and climate change (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions). However, in the vast majority of countries that have bioenergy and biofuels policies, there is either no policy support for biobased materials (especially chemicals and plastics) or it is limited to R&D subsidy. And yet, studies repeatedly show that higher added value and job creation are to be found in materials production. This paper suggests a cost-effective public policy strategy to redress this balance. The strategy also addresses a weakness of bio-based production - low efficiency - by creating stimulus for companies to innovate their biocatalysts and bioprocesses.","620":"Modular tissue engineering holds great potential in regenerating natural complex tissues by engineering three-dimensional modular scaffolds with predefined geometry and biological characters. In modular tissue-like Construction, a scaffold with an appropriate mechanical rigidity for assembling fabrication and high biocompatibility for,cell survival is the key to the successful bioconstruction. In this Work, a Series of composite hydrogels (GH0, GH1, GH2, and GH3) based on a combination of methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) wag exploited to enhance hydrogel Mechanical rigidity and promote cell functional expression for osteon biofabrication. These composite hydrogels presented a lower swelling ratio, higher mechanical moduli, and better biocompatibility When compared to the pure GelMA hydrogel. Furthermore, on the basis of the composite hydrogel and photolithograph technology, We Successfully constructed an osteon-like concentric double-ring structure :in which the inner ring encapsulating human umbilical vascular endothelial Cells (HUVECs) was designed to imitate blood vessel tubule while the outer ring encapsulating human osteoblast-like cells (MG63s) acts as part of bone. During the coculture period, MG63s and HUVECs exhibited not only satisfying growth status but also the enhanced genic expression, of osteogenesis-related and angiogenesis-related differentiations. These results demonstrate this GelMA HA composite hydrogel system is promising for modular tissue engineering.","7053":"A facile in-situ chemical reduction and self-assembly method was developed to prepare graphene and tin oxide (graphene@SnO2) composite fibers. The obtained graphene@SnO2 fiber exhibits excellent tensile mechanical performance with high mechanical strength and superior plastic deformation (mechanical strength up to 65MPa with an ultimate elongation about 7%). The electrical resistance of the graphene@SnO2 fiber holds steady and has a negligible change in either the bent or straight status over 100 cycles. In the prepared composite fibers, SnO2 nanoparticles with sizes of 3-5nm homogeneously dispersed on the graphene sheets. The conductivity of GF@SnO2 was about 6.0-2.5 S\/cm with the increase content of Sn4+ due to the tin oxide semiconductor doping.","3615":"Polyethylene oxide (PEO) functionalized graphene (f-G) was prepared by ultrasonication of pristine graphene in PEO aqueous solution. The feasible sonication protocol of PEO degradation and graphene functionalization enabled fabrication of solvent cast nanocomposites. Additionally, the steps to form new bio-nanocomposite films have been described. Taking the advantage of the combination of graphene, PEO and keratin fibers from poultry feather waste, the aforementioned bio-nanocomposite films were designed with extraordinary properties allowing the films to have promising applications as eventual packaging materials and enabling bio-waste keratin to be converted into value-added materials. Compared to neat PEO, addition of only 0.3 wt% f-G provided an increase of 92% to the storage modulus. These findings are similar to the nanoindentation results, which yielded increases in the reduced modulus of the same composition by about 92%. Nanoindentation testing shows that the incorporation of 0.3 wt% f-G increased the reduced modulus and hardness of the keratin-PEO blend by about 155 and 99%, respectively.","6362":"Nanocomposite materials obtained by laser pyrolysis are very popular lately in biological applications at cellular level, but the major issue for these nanoparticles is their dispersion and functionalization. In this article, we describe the stabilization and functionalization of iron based magnetic nanoparticles using two different biopolymeric materials, namely chitosan and hyaluronic acid. We have obtained the iron oxide nanoparticles by laser pyrolysis technique, (maghemite phase) with precise size control and narrow size distributions. The nanoparticles were dispersed in water with chitosan and hyaluronic acid and were analyzed with TEM, DLS and FTIR. This progress, together with the availability of suitable biocompatible coverage, are both of crucial importance, as premises for their biomedical applications.","478":"The antioxidant properties of 21 non-phenolic terpenoids contained in essential oil extracted from the buds of Cleistocalyx operculatus have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT)-based computational methods. The C-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE), proton affinity (PA), electron transfer enthalpy (ETE) and ionization energy (IE) were calculated in the gas phase and in two different solvents (water and ethanol) at the ROB3LYP\/6-311++G(2df,2p)\/\/B3LYP\/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for the former and with the PM6 method for the latter. Quantum chemical descriptors like chemical potential (mu), chemical hardness (eta), and global electrophilicity (omega) were calculated in order to evaluate the reactivity and stability of all studied compounds. The interaction of the HOO center dot radical with alpha-terpinene, an example molecule, was also studied in detail by establishing a potential energy surface (PES). As a result, a kinetic concurrence between the H-abstraction reaction at the weakest C-H bond and addition reactions at the C=C double bonds was clarified. On the basis of this mechanism, the antioxidant capacity may happen via the termination-enhancing process. Among the studied compounds, alpha-terpinene, gamma-terpinene, cembrene and abieta-7,13-diene represent potential antioxidants.","5950":"A hybrid device that combines the properties of organic and inorganic semiconductors was fabricated and studied. It incorporated poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)- 1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as organic polymers and GaN nanoneedles as an inorganic semiconductor. Layers of the two polymers were spin coated on to the GaN nanoneedles. The one peak in the electroluminescence spectrum originated from the MEH-PPV layer owing to the different potential barriers of electrons and holes at its interface with the GaN nanoneedles. However, the photoluminescence spectrum showed peaks due to both GaN nanoneedles and MEH-PPV. Such hybrid structures, suitably developed, might be able to improve the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we develop a series of nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbon (NMC) with extremely high mesoporosity and tunable mesopore size by a two-step method using silica gel as template. In our approach, mesopore size can be easily tailored from 4.7 to 35 nm by increasing the HF\/TEOS volume ratio from 1\/100 to 1\/4. The NMC with mesopores of 6.2 nm presents the largest mesopore volume, surface area and mesopore ratio of 2.56 cm(3) g(-1), 1003 m(2) g(-1) and 97.7%, respectively. As a result, the highest specific capacitance of 325 F g(-1) can be obtained at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1), which can stay over 88% (286 F g(-1)) as the current density increases by 100 times (10 A g(-1)).

FBPY demonstrated blue or red shift in emission wavelength and fluorescence quenching when chelating with different metal ions. With appropriate composition of SA in the copolymer, films and nanofibers could maintain their morphology in aqueous solution at different thermal treatments. Polymers in three states, solution, film and nanofiber, were prepared and their effects on sensing ability were investigated. The smooth nanofibers prepared from P2 (with copolymer composition of NIPAAm:SA:FBPY = 93:6:1) demonstrated superior sensitivity as low as 10(-5) M in sensing zinc ions as compared to polymer films (10(-3) M) due to the high specific surface area of nanofibers. The porous nanofibers of P2 were also manufactured to further enhance sensing performance and showed the best sensitivity (10(-6) M) among three states when sensing with zinc ions (sensitivitY of polymer solution in THF was about 10(-5) M). These nanofibers also exhibit an interesting \"on\/off' switch behavior with decreasing temperature from 40 to 10 degrees C due to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition of NIPAAm moieties which cause the gradual swelling of nanofibers. These results indicated that the new nanofibers could have potential applications in multifunctional sensory devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Its structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR). Its flame retardancy and thermal stability were assessed by limiting oxygen index (LOI) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA showed that the degradation occurred in two stages with varying mass rate losses of PCP. The PCP showed higher initial decomposition temperature (T-i), final degradation temperature (T-f), and maximum degradation temperature (T-max) than cardanol diol (CD) of the same class, and also had higher mass residual than CD (6.77% vs. 0.02%). To study the flame retardancy of PCP, we prepared a series of polyurethane foams (PUFs) with different PCP content. LOI increased continuously with the increasing content of PCP added into PUF. The thermal degradation of PCP was disclosed by TGA-FTIR and TGA-MS. During degradation, PCP continued to release PO free radicals and o-phenylphenoxyl free radicals, which acted as scavengers of H-center dot and OH center dot during two degradation stages at 200 degrees C. Moreover, the phosphaphenanthrene group may create a char residue acting as a barrier for the polymer matrix.","1400":"Implantation of sustained antibacterial system after abdominal surgery could effectively prevent complicated intra-abdominal infection. In this study, a simple blended electrospun membrane made of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA)\/poly(dioxanone) (PDO)\/Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CiH) could easily result in approximately linear drug release profile and sustained antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The addition of PDO changed the stack structure of PLGA, which in turn influenced the fiber swelling and created drug diffusion channels. It could be a good candidate for reducing postoperative infection or be associated with other implant to resist biofilm formation.","1385":"In the present work, a multi-functional monomer triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) of 4 wt% is incorporated into neat poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) by twin screw extrusion technique and the PBS sheets are irradiated at various electron beam absorption doses. It has been found that electron beam irradiation at an appropriate absorption dose plays an effective role in crosslinking the PBS molecules in the presence of TAIC As a result, the irradiation influences the gel fraction, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, thermo-dimensional stability, dynamic storage modulus, and tensile properties of PBS, depending on the electron beam absorption dose applied. The improvement of the thermal and mechanical properties of PBS is most significant in the range of 50 to 70 kGy.

This method has been continuously developed to overcome limitations and is now suitable for a wide variety of drug molecules. In this work, the influences of electric field and conductive polymer were investigated for developing a unique drug delivery system from double-centrifuged natural rubber (DCNR) matrix. Indomethacin (IN) was loaded into polycarbazole (PCz) as a conductive polymer drug host to promote the efficient transportation of the drug. The IN-loaded PCz was blended with DCNR to form a transdermal patch. The permeation of IN through the PCz\/NR film and pig skin was carrried out by a modified Franz diffusion cell. The IN diffused from DCNR film by the diffusion controlled combined with erosion mechanism depending on the pore formation period. The drug permeation increased with decreasing cross-link ratio because of more accessible pathways for the drug permeation. Moreover, an electric field and the inclusion of PCz as the drug carrier dramatically improved the diffusion of the drug from the membrane by through the electrorepulsive force and electro-reduced PCz expansion. Thus, the PCz\/DCNR films are shown here as a potential transdermal patch under applied electric field.

Surveillance and control must be considered owing to a great risk of infection with dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses. Although investigations on several vaccines are in progress, new insights in term of development of drugs that evade from resistance are of paramount importance. Nanobiotechnology appears as one of the most innovative strategy in the search of new uses for old pharmaceuticals or in the development of innovative and intelligent nanomedicines for neglected diseases. Liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon dots and carbon nanotubes were the focus of the current advances.

However, improving the overall efficiency of water splitting is a challenging issue. Here, we designed Co-Fe nanoparticle coupled nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (CoyFe10-yOx\/NPC) nanosheets as highly efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (NPC) nanosheets were prepared using a Schiff-base network (SNW) as the precursor and the SNW was based on commercially available and inexpensive monomers which were terephthalaldehyde and melamine. The resulting SNW possessed a high nitrogen content, a high surface area and a high density of metalcoordination sites. In addition, when used as the catalyst for the OER, the Co-Fe nanoparticle catalyst containing 30% Co (Co3Fe7Ox\/NPC) showed the highest activity, requiring 328 mV over-potential to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 15 h and a small Tafel slope of 31.4 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which were comparable even superior to those of many other non-noble metal catalysts. Consequently, the high efficiency and durability make these supported amorphous Co-Fe nanoparticles potentially applicable for improving the performance for electrolysis of water and energy storage applications. More importantly, the support of electrode materials comes from the pyrolysis of porous polymers and this idea offers a new possibility for exploring overall water splitting non-precious-metal catalysts.","550":"Laminaria residues are major wastes during the production of alginate, mannitol and iodine by the kelp industry. To explore the capability of using Laminaria residues for microbial lipid production, here we developed an effective hydrolysis process to prepare Laminaria residue hydrolysates (LRH). Ten oleaginous yeast strains were then screened on agar plates using LRH as the sole nutrient sources. Two strains, Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 and Rhodotorula glutinis AS 2.107, were found to use LRH for lipid production when phosphorus was removed, and lipid yields and cellular lipid contents reached 0.16 g g(-1) total reducing sugar (TRS) and 37.6%, and 0.07 g g(-1) TRS and 22.2%, respectively. The lipid products had similar fatty acid composition profiles to those of vegetable oils. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating lipid-based biofuel production and the kelp industry, which should facilitate more efficient utilization of macroalgae resources such as Laminaria and related marine biomass.","2868":"Stimuli-responsive DNA-functionalized nano-and microcontainers composed of mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticles (MP SiO2 NPs), microcapsules, or micelles\/vesicles act as carriers for the transport and release of drugs. The information encoded in the DNA sequences provides instructive information for the gating of drug-loaded pores of MP SiO2 NPs, for the assembly and degradation of microcapsules or lipid-DNA micelles\/vesicles, and for the targeting of nano-\/microcontainers to cancer cells. Different triggers are applied to release the drugs loaded in the nano-\/microcontainers by unlocking the pores of the MP SiO2 NPs or by degradation of the containers. These include the use of switchable DNA nanostructures (nucleic acid hairpins, i-motif, G-quadruplexes) and the implementation of chemical, thermal, or photonic stimuli. Also, catalytic processes stimulated by DNAzymes or enzymes are used to release drugs from the nano-\/microcontainers.","3751":"We describe a strategy to chlorinate stereocomplementary acyclic aliphatic 1,3-diols using a mixture of triphosgene and pyridine. While 1,3-anti diols readily led to 1,3-anti dichlorides, 1,3-syn diols must be converted to 1,3-syn diol monosilylethers to access the corresponding 1,3-syn dichlorides. These dichlorination protocols were operationally simple, very mild, and readily tolerated by advanced synthetic intermediates.","2641":"Many organisms build crystals with almost complete control over all aspects of crystal formation, from nucleation to growth, from composition to polymorphic structure, and from morphology to size. In biomineralization, the control is fundamentally always exerted at the level of nanometers, because the building blocks themselves are at the nanoscale. We have chosen to describe in some detail four biological systems that produce nanoscale crystals using different mineralization pathways, different levels of control, and have different functions. These four cases are: bone crystal composites; guanine nanocrystal reflectors; magnetotactic bacteria with single domain magnets; and coccoliths, whose functions have yet to be identified. This is followed by a discussion aimed at identifying possible specific and\/or common underlying principles involved in nanocrystal formation in biology.","5153":"p-Type Co3O4 photocathodes with different amounts of CuO, were synthesized on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) via electrodeposition from a chloride bath containing suspended starch particles. All of the fabricated samples were photoresponsive toward water splitting in 0.5 M Na2SO4 under simulated sun-light. The PEC performance was evaluated using LSPV, chronoamperometry, and EIS techniques. The samples fabricated via the electrodeposition\/anodizing\/annealing process showed greater photocurrent response compared to the electrodeposition\/annealing process. Among all the samples, the sample with an atomic composition% of Co: 24.9, Cu: 25.0 and O: 50.1 showed an optimum photocurrent response (similar to 6.5 mA cm(-2) vs. SCE at -0.3 V). The structure, morphology\/composition and optical response were characterized by XRD, FESEM\/EDX and UV-Vis techniques, respectively.","5863":"In recent years, graphene films have been used in a series of wide applications in the biomedical area, because of several advantageous characteristics. Currently, these films are derived from graphene oxide (GO) via chemical or physical reduction methods, which results in a significant decrease in surface hydrophilicity, although the electrical property could be greatly improved, because of the reduction process. Hence, the comprehensive performance of the graphene films showed practical limitations in the biomedical field, because of incompatibility of highly hydrophobic surfaces to support cell adhesion and growth. In this work, we present a novel fabrication of bacterial cellulose nanofibers\/reduced graphene oxide (BC-RGO) film, using a bacterial reduction method. Thus-prepared BC-RGO films maintained excellent hydrophilicity, while electrical properties were improved by bacterial reduction of GO films in culture. Human marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on these surfaces showed improved cellular response with higher cell proliferation on the BC-RGO film, compared to free-standing reduced graphene oxide film without the nanoscale fibrous structure. Furthermore, the cellular adhesion and proliferation were even comparable to that on the tissue culture plate, indicating that the bacterial cellulose nanofibers play a critically contructive role in supporting cellular activities. The novel fabrication method greatly enhanced the biochemical activity of the cells on the surface, which could aid in realizing several potential applications of graphene film in biomedical area, such as tissue engineering, bacterial devices, etc.","5454":"Transparent electrodes based on silver nanowire (AgNW) films have attracted considerable attention owing to their high electrical and thermal conductivity, optical transparency, and flexibility. However, the long-term reliability of AgNW electrodes, has seldom been studied. In this work, the effects of storage environment, such as, natural light and humidity, on the long-term reliability have been investigated in detail. The increase of electrical resistance with storage time greatly depended on the natural light illumination, especially ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and high humidity seriously accelerated the failure of AgNW electrodes. All the results were dependent on the storage temperature. Some over-coating layers have been used to protect the AgNW electrodes from light and humidity in environment and the results showed that an epoxy resin protecting layer exhibited the longest lifetime: over 40 days at 85 degrees C and 85% relative humidity.","6526":"Biodegradable polymeric nanostructures (BPNs) have shown great promise in different therapeutic applications such as diagnosis, imaging, drug delivery, cosmetics, organ implants, and tissue engineering.

Herein, we used the highly conductive graphene hydrogel (GH) with a well-defined 3D macroporous structure as a support to electrodeposite polyaniline (PANI), aimed to improve the energy density of GH-based capacitor electrode without deteriorating its high power capability. The as-prepared GH\/PANI heterostructure with thin PANI layer conformally coated on the GH framework totally retains the native hydrogel pore structure and its high surface area, which facilitates the effective electron and ion transport within the electrode and thus endows GH\/PANI composite electrode with excellent electrochemical properties such as a specific capacitance of 710 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and 73% capacitance retention upon a current increase to 100 A g(-1). Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor device based on GH\/PANI heterostructure electrode delivers a maximum energy density and power density of 24 W h kg(-1) and 30 kW kg(-1,) respectively, and also exhibits a good cycling stability with 86% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles.

For stem cell applications, graphene has been utilized by itself or in combination with other types of materials such as nanoparticles, nanofibers, and polymer scaffolds to take advantage of the several unique properties of graphene, such as the flexibility in size, shape, hydrophilicity, as well as its excellent biocompatibility. In this review, we will highlight a number of previous studies that have investigated the potential of graphene or its derivatives for stem cell applications, with a particular focus on guiding stem cell differentiation into specific lineages (e.g., osteogenesis, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis), promoting stem cell growth, stem cell delivery\/transplantation, and effective monitoring of their differentiation. We hope that this review promotes and accelerates the use of graphene-based materials for regenerative therapies, especially for stem cell-based approaches to cure various incurable diseases\/disorders such as neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), stroke, spinal cord injuries, bone\/cartilage defects, and cardiovascular diseases.","1803":"Polystyrene (PS) nanofibers incorporated with ion-pair (IP) reagent, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDSn), were developed as functional adsorbents for the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of ionic neurotransmitter such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), prior to the determination by high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). A comprehensive study was initiated to optimize the preconcentration step by exploring the main factors that affect the extraction\/preconcentration efficiency of 5-HT, such as the composition of nanofibers, eluent and its volume, amount of adsorbent, pH and ionic strength. The validity of this method was investigated and optimal analytical performance was achieved including a wide dynamic range of 0.50-200 ng mL(-1), detection limits of 0.50 ng mL(-1) and precision (as RSD%) lower than 4% for both intra-day and inter-day assays. This method was then applied to the determination of 5-HT in human plasma with satisfactory results.","1406":"Light harvesting supramolecular assemblies are potentially useful structures as components of solar-to-fuel conversion materials. The development of these functional constructs requires an understanding of optimal packing modes for chromophores. We investigated here assembly in water and the photocatalytic function of perylene monoimide chromophore amphiphiles with different alkyl linker lengths separating their hydrophobic core and the hydrophilic carboxylate headgroup. We found that these chromophore amphiphiles (CAs) self-assemble into charged nanostructures of increasing aspect ratio as the linker length is increased. The addition of salt to screen the charged nanostructures induced the formation of hydrogels and led to internal crystallization within some of the nanostructures. For linker lengths up to seven methylenes, the CAs were found to pack into 2D crystalline unit cells within ribbon-shaped nanostructures, whereas the nine methylene CAs assembled into long nanofibers without crystalline molecular packing. At the same time, the different molecular packing arrangements after charge screening led to different absorbance spectra, despite the identical electronic properties of all PMI amphiphiles. While the crystalline CAs formed electronically coupled H-aggregates, only CAs with intermediate linker lengths showed evidence of high intermolecular orbital overlap. Photocatalytic hydrogen production using a nickel-based catalyst was observed in all hydrogels, with the highest turnovers observed for CA gels having intermediate linker lengths. We conclude that the improved photocatalytic performance of the hydrogels formed by supramolecular assemblies of the intermediate linker CA molecules likely arises from improved exciton splitting efficiencies due to their higher orbital overlap.","5704":"Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanocrystals represent a family of emerging nanomaterials with many proposed applications; however, the interlayer re-stacking between sheets greatly decreases the performance during practical operation. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to solve this challenging problem by rational assembly of 2D nanocrystals into three-dimensional (3D) aerogels, which paves the way for harvesting excellent structural properties of both nanostructures and macrostructures. The resultant 3D MnO2 aerogel shows significantly increased discharge capacity in Li-air batteries in comparison to its powder-like counterpart (4581.4 vs. 3902.6 mA h g(-1)), which outperforms many MnO2 and other transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, the as-fabricated Li-air cell demonstrates good rate capability and cycle life. Further mechanism study reveals that the improved performance is associated with ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets which allow highly exposed catalytic centres, as well as its excellent aerogel structure with rich porosity and a 3D continuous network that maximizes the utilization of MnO2 species for catalytic reactions. This study may open up new opportunities for making full use of 2D nanocrystals for a number of energy storage\/conversion techniques.","6081":"Nano Fibrillar Cellulose (NFC) is fast emerging as a biomaterial with promising applications, one of which is cellular foam. The inner structure of the foam can take various shapes and hierarchical micro-structures depending on the manufacturing parameters. The compressive response of foams developed from these materials is currently a primary criterion for the material development. In this work, we focus on the connection between the non-linear part of the response and the inner structure of the material. We study the effect of internal contact and its contribution to gradual stiffening in the energy absorbing region and accelerated stiffening in the densification region of the large strain compressive response. We use the finite element method in this study and discuss the applicability and efficiency of different modelling techniques by considering well defined geometries and available experimental data. The relative contribution of internal contact is singled out and mapped onto the overall compressive response of the material. The effect of initial non-straightness of the cell walls is studied through superposing differing percentages of the buckling modes on the initial geometry. The initial non-straightness is seen to have a significant effect for only strains up to 1%. The secant modulus measured at slightly higher strains of 4%, demonstrates lesser effect from the non-straightness of cell walls. The simulations capture the compressive response well into the densification regime and there is an order of magnitude agreement in between simulations and experiments. We observed that internal contact is crucial for capturing the trend of compressive response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The simplicity and the relative low cost of this kind of cells make them very interesting and promising in the development of chemical and biochemical sensors. The utilization of microelectrodes as working electrodes in planar electrochemical cells is preferred to the conventional macro electrodes because microelectrodes can be used in highly resistive media, have short response time, and excellent signal to noise ratio. In electrochemical sensor applications, the microelectrode surfaces are commonly modified with multiple layers to boost selectivity, control sensitivity, or to provide a biocompatible interface between the sensor and its environment. In this work, the fabricated set of bundled electrodes is covered with a hydrogel as an example of its potential use as electrochemical gas sensor. All micro electrochemical cells were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the results were analyzed with different statistical methods.","7092":"Nowadays, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) research is centred in the development of composite bioabsorbable membranes with enhanced bioactivity and with processing controlled at the nanoscale. Inspired by this new focus of GTR research and also by nacre structure, layered freestanding membranes were produced using the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition technique, combining chitosan (CHI), hyaluronic acid (HA) and bioactive glass nanoparticles (BGNPs). It is expected that the combination of these materials processed by this particular technique will result in nanostructured membranes with enhanced mechanical performance as well as improved bioactivity. Moreover, the effect of the modification of HA with catechol groups (HAD) on the adhesive properties of the membranes was also analysed. The results showed that it was possible to produce biomimetic membranes with different surface properties, improved adhesive strength and the ability to induce the formation of apatite, necessary for the formation of new bone. It was also possible to control the BGNPs content of the membranes by use of HAD instead of unmodified HA and changing the number of BGNPs' deposition steps. Moreover, it was shown that membranes with different concentrations of BGNPs possess different mechanical performance, swelling properties and degradation behaviour, which indicates the possibility to tune the membranes' properties by controlling the deposition of BGNPs onto the membranes.","1864":"A novel, magnetic nanocarrier was successfully synthesized through a facile and economical producer in which Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were coated by starch-g-poly (methyl methacrylate-co-PEG-acrylamide). The surface of nanocarrier was then modified by hydrazine to preparation of a pH responsive carrier. The resulted nanocarrier was applied for delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) as an effective anti-cancer drug. DOX was reacted with hydrazine linkage on the surface of nanocarrier to form hydrazone bond. Due to the presence of numerous hydrazine groups on the surface of magnetic nanocarrier large amounts of DOX was loaded onto the carrier (327 mg g(-1)).

As well as the common enhancing mechanism of limiting crack propagation in the polymer matrix, the nanofibers further initiated the shear bands in the epoxy resin to give a higher tensile strength (90.36 MPa) than that of pure epoxy (70.03 MPa) and even that of the epoxy nanocomposites with nanospheres (84.53 MPa). With a larger specific surface area, the nanofibers rather than nanospheres were observed to reduce the flammability of epoxy more efficiently by assisting more char formation of the epoxy resin. The hydroxyl groups formed between the protons of the doped acid in the PPy nanofillers and the epoxy broke the conjugate structure of PPy, leading to a higher bandgap in the nanocomposites (E-g1 - 3.08 eV for 1.0 wt% PPy nanofibers) than that of pure nanofillers (1.8 eV for PPy nanofibers and 1.2 eV for PPy nanospheres). Due to the high aspect ratio, the PPy nanofibers could form the conductive path more easily than the PPy nanospheres to provide a lower percolation threshold value. The real permittivity was observed to increase with increasing the PPy nanofiller loading, and the enhanced permittivity was interpreted by the interfacial polarization.","5608":"Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have emerged as excellent nanotransducers for converting longer wavelength near-infrared (NIR) light to shorter wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible (Vis) regions of the spectrum via a multiphoton absorption process, known as upconversion. Here, we report the development of NIR to UV-Vis-NIR UCNPs consisting of LiYF4:Yb3+\/Tm3+@SiO2 individually coated with a 10 +\/- 2 nm layer of chitosan (CH) hydrogel cross-linked with a photocleavable cross-linker (PhL). We encapsulated fluorescent-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) inside the gel. Under 980 nm excitation, the upconverted UV emission cleaves the PhL cross-links and instantaneously liberates the FITC-BSA under 2 cm thick tissue. The release is immediately arrested if the excitation source is switched off. The upconverted NIR light allows for the tracking of particles under the tissue. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells cultured with UCNPs are viable both in the presence and in the absence of laser irradiation. Controlled drug delivery of large biomolecules and deep tissue imaging make this system an excellent theranostic platform for tissue engineering, biomapping, and cellular imaging applications.","6492":"Paper degradation by iron gall ink is a challenging issue for the conservation of ancient manuscripts. It is usually attributed to both FeII catalyzed oxidation and acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose, yet the dominant degradation pathway remains an open question. In this work, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to identify radicals involved in cellulose degradation. Papers impregnated with iron salts were put in contact with an aqueous solution of DMPO (spin-trap) and analyzed by ESR. No DMPO-OH center dot adducts were detected while the addition of formate, an intermediary target molecule, led on the contrary to the detection of a significant amount of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts. This reveals the predominant occurrence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) other than hydroxyl radicals (most likely superoxide or hydroperoxyl radicals). The production of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts was found to be oxygen dependent and to originate mainly from ferrous ions lixiviated from the impregnated papers. At high iron loads (above 1 mmol L-1), it was shown that quantification of these adducts should be done with great care because of a competing formation of hydroxylamine that jeopardizes the ESR signal. Complementary TPA hydroxylation measurements performed by HPLC on ink and iron sulfate impregnated papers revealed some production of hydroxyl radicals but at a concentration several orders of magnitude below that of the ROS detected with formation of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts. This HO center dot production was moreover not correlated with cellulose chain scissions, indicating that autooxidation by these radicals is not the main mechanism of cellulose depolymerisation in presence of iron gall ink.","1281":"","701":"In the printing plate developing process, the offset printing developer undergoes changes, as well as enrichment by the various chemicals, i.e. metals, organic binders and photosensitive compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the electrocoagulation\/flotation (ECF) treatment efficiency for the removal of copper, turbidity and organic substances from the waste offset printing developer (WOPD). The effect of operational parameters, such as electrode materials, current density, interelectrode distance and operating time, was studied. Also, the response surface analysis was applied to evaluate the effect of main operational variables and to get a balanced removal efficiency of investigated WOPD parameters by ECF treatment. The removal efficiency increases significantly with the increasing of operating time and mainly increases with the increasing of current density. The obtained results show that the interelectrode distance and combinations of electrodes determine the removal efficiency of copper, turbidity and organic substances. Based on the obtained results, the optimized parameters for the ECF treatment removal of investigated WOPD parameters were identified as: Al(-)\/Fe(+) electrode combination with interelectrode distance of 1.0 cm, operating time of 5 min and current density of 8 mA cm(-2). This study confirms the practical feasibility of ECF method for treating real printing industrial effluent under optimum conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It was observed that the presence of GO greatly affect the viscosity of RSF solution. The RSF\/GO hybrid fibers showed from FTIR result lower beta-sheet content compared to that of pure RSF fibers. The result of synchrotron radiation wide-angle X-ray diffraction showed that the addition of GO confined the crystallization of silk fibroin (SF) leading to the decrease of crystallinity, smaller crystallite size, and new formation of interphase zones in the artificial silks. Synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering also proved that GO sheets in the hybrid silks and blended solutions were coated with a certain thickness of interphase zones due to the complex interaction between the two components. A low addition of GO, together with the mesophase zones formed between GO and RSF, enhanced the mechanical properties of hybrid fibers. The highest breaking stress of the hybrid fibers reached 435.5 +\/- 71.6 MPa, 23% improvement in comparison to that of degummed silk and 72% larger than that of pure RSF silk fiber. The hybrid RSF\/GO materials with good biocompatibility and enhanced mechanical properties may have potential applications in tissue engineering, bioelectronic devices, or energy storage.","6075":"Transforming plant biomass to biofuel is one of the few solutions that can truly sustain mankind's long-term needs for liquid transportation fuel with minimized environmental impact. However, despite decades of effort, commercial development of biomass-to-biofuel conversion processes is still not an economically viable proposition. Identifying value-added co-products along with the production of biofuel provides a key solution to overcoming this economic barrier. Lignin is the second most abundant component next to cellulose in almost all plant biomass; the emerging biomass refinery industry will inevitably generate an enormous amount of lignin. Development of selective biorefinery lignin-to-bioproducts conversion processes will play a pivotal role in significantly improving the economic feasibility and sustainability of biofuel production from renewable biomass. The urgency and importance of this endeavor has been increasingly recognized in the last few years. This paper reviews state-of-the-art oxidative lignin depolymerization chemistries employed in the papermaking process and oxidative catalysts that can be applied to biorefinery lignin to produce platform chemicals including phenolic compounds, dicarboxylic acids, and quinones in high selectivity and yield. The potential synergies of integrating new catalysts with commercial delignification chemistries are discussed. We hope the information will build on the existing body of knowledge to provide new insights towards developing practical and commercially viable lignin conversion technologies, enabling sustainable biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass to be competitive with fossil fuel.","2623":"This paper presents an analysis of the damage propagation features of the pore structure of natural pumice lightweight aggregate concrete (LWC) under freeze-thaw cyclic action. After freeze-thaw cycling, we conducted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests on the concrete and acquired the porosity, distribution of transverse relaxation time T-2, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. The results showed the following. The T-2 distribution of the LWC prior to freeze-thaw cycling presented four peaks representative of a preponderance of small pores. After 50, 100, 150, and 200 freeze-thaw cycles, the total area of the T2 spectrum and the porosity increased significantly. The MRI presented the changing spatial distribution of pores within the LWC during freeze-thaw cycling. Ultrasonic testing technology was applied simultaneously to analyze the NMR results, which verified that the new NMR technology demonstrated high accuracy and practicability for research regarding freeze-thaw concrete damage.","6921":"Refrigeration is a common method for preserving reconstituted silk fibroin (RSF) aqueous solutions during electrospinning experiments, but the effects of preservation time at 4 A degrees C are still not well documented. In this work, we explore its effects on the viscosity, refractive index, and density values of RSF solutions at 19 wt%. Also, extensive characterization of the mechanical properties and fiber diameters of the resulting electrospun meshes are provided. Significant differences were found in elongation, YoungA ' s modulus, and ultimate strength at different experimental times, and an increase in the viscosity values of the RSF solutions was detected for the first 12 days of storage. These solutions exhibited a continuous, slow gelation throughout the time in storage at 4 A degrees C, and this phenomenon improved the performance of electrospinning after a certain period of refrigeration. The protocol used reduces the production cost of SF fiber-based scaffolds and avoids the use of harsh solvents and additives which could otherwise limit their use in potential biomedical applications.","6783":"This paper presents fabrication of polyacrylamide (PAM) and PAM\/poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) inverse opal photonic crystal hydrogels (IOHs) based on poly(styrene-acrylic acid) (PSA) template by a \"Sandwich\" method. SEM images showed the obtained IOHs had a three-dimensional ordered structure and extremely uniform pore size without over-layers and defects. The IOHs exhibited brilliant structural color by controlling the PSA particle size, MAA and cross-linker compositions. The color and Bragg diffraction peak of the IOHs responded to external stimuli such as pH, methanol and ethanol. The reflectance was red-shifted in low pH and blue-shifted in high pH and in the presence of methanol and ethanol. The effects of the MAA and cross-linker composition on the response properties of the IOHs were investigated. The PMAA in the IOHs provided -COOH groups that are apt to form hydrogen bonds with water, enhancing the response sensitivity.","833":"Self-powered flexible inorganic electronic systems have been demonstrated to be the core of next-generation electronics due to their lightweight, thin, self-sustainable and biocompatible properties, which are applicable to cramped or corrugated surfaces. Many researchers have studied myriad approaches for high performance flexible electronics, e.g. energy harvesters, batteries, high-density memories, large-scale integration (LSI), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and sensors.

Such MNPs, surface modified with chitosan-glutaraldehyde (Fe3O4-CH\/GLD) i.e. magnetic core\/shell nanostructures, were used in the present study to investigate isolation and enrichment of bacterial DNA. Isolation was carried out in comparison with an organic method. FTIR was used to confirm biding of DNA onto the surface of the core-shell structures. The concentration of isolated DNA (yield) was 14.90 and 17.55 mu g mL(-1) for phenol\/chloroform and magnetic isolation methods, respectively. The purity of isolated DNA was found to be 1.69 and 1.71 for phenol\/chloroform and magnetic isolation methods, respectively. The present study firstly reports the comparison between magnetic and organic isolation of DNA. From both results (yield and purity), it was found that magnetic isolation of DNA was superior to the general organic method used for bacterial DNA isolation. Experiments for DNA enrichment were performed in batch mode and the effects of core\/shell concentration, pH of the sample solution and temperature were optimized. The formation energy required for adsorption of DNA was found to be -55.56 x 10(-23) J per molecule (-34.70 x 10(-4) eV per molecule). The negative value indicates energy was utilized (endothermic process) for the adsorption of DNA onto the magnetic core\/shells. The magnetic isolation method used in the present study was simple, fast, robust and ecofriendly (it does not require organic solvents or sophisticated equipment).","5832":"Chitosan contains amine and amino groups which have the ability to generate cationic type surfactants when combined with H+ ions. It has a high potential for use as a cationic emulsifier for negatively charged siliceous aggregates for paving of roads in Sri Lanka. Water soluble Chitosan was tested for suitability as an emulsifier in the production of cationic bituminous emulsions. The amine emulsifier currently in use was fractionally replaced with Chitosan and tested for emulsion properties; emulsion viscosity, storage stability, settlement, sieve test and breaking of emulsion. The viscosity of the emulsion was found to increase significantly from 16 SFS to 50 SFS and from 20 SFS to 72 SFS for Cationic Rapid Setting type (CRS1) emulsion and Cationic Slow Setting type (CSS1) emulsions respectively. For both types of emulsions, an exponential growth in viscosity was found to occur at a critical Chitosan to bitumen ratio of 0.0028. Results of storage stability indicated a tendency for floating, while in the presence of Chitosan, within the first 24 h of preparation. However, a settling tendency developed for both types of emulsion when in longer storage as indicated by a 5 day settlement test. A new model based on the interaction between reactive groups of Chitosan and bitumen emulsion droplets was proposed to describe the effect of Chitosan on bitumen emulsion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The porous carbon was efficiently activated through simultaneous chemical and physical reactions using potassium hydroxide as an activation agent during the heat treatment. Surface area analysis showed that the activated carbon possessed mesopores (similar to 15 nm) and a large specific surface area of 2661 m(2) g(-1), with a cheese-like morphology. Electrochemical double layer capacitors fabricated using the activated carbon as an electrode material showed a specific capacitance of 248 F g(-1) at a low current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and 211 F g(-1) at a high current density of 10 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH solution. Charge and discharge for 1000 cycles at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 10 A g(-1) confirmed excellent specific capacitance retention and good cycling stability. This work demonstrates that the nitrogen-doped cheese-like porous activated carbon is a promising electrode material for electric double layer capacitors.","1020":"Aim: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea. In this study, we investigated the effects of EGCG on insulin resistance and insulin clearance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice. Methods: Mice were fed on a high-fat diet for 24 weeks. During the last 4 weeks, the mice were injected with EGCG (10, 20 and 40 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip). Glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance and insulin clearance were assessed. After the mice were euthanized, blood samples and tissue specimens were collected. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined in isolated pancreatic islets. The progression of NAFLD was evaluated histologically and by measuring lipid contents. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) protein expression and enzyme activity were detected using Western blot and immunocapture activity assays, respectively. Results: The high-fat diet significantly increased the body weight and induced grade 2 or 3 liver fatty degeneration (steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning) accompanied by severe hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the model mice. Administration of EGCG dose-dependently ameliorated the hepatic morphology and function, reduced the body weight, and alleviated hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in NAFLD mice. Furthermore, EGCG dosedependently enhanced insulin clearance and upregulated IDE protein expression and enzyme activity in the liver of NAFLD mice. Conclusion: EGCG dose-dependently improves insulin resistance in NAFLD mice not only by reducing body weight but also through enhancing the insulin clearance by hepatic IDE. The results suggest that IDE be a potential drug target for the treatment of NAFLD.","248":"Using biodegradable material in medicinal applications is known as an important factor. On the other hand, the delivery of drugs directly to the target site is a promising field of research especially for anti-cancer drug delivery systems. The present research aimed to evaluate an effective anti-cancer device for treatment of tumors. In this respect, a novel fluorescent multi core-shell structure of magnetic molecular imprinted polymer nanoparticles based on biodegradable materials was designed as a carrier for targeted, sustained and controlled release of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Herein, tannic acid as a biodegradable polyphenol with potential anti-cancer performance was used to fabricate a cross-linker agent. Then, a mini-emulsion polymerization technique was performed in the presence of magnetic fluorescent cores for preparing the carrier. The structure of samples was fully characterized using various kinds of analyses. Afterwards, the performance of the product as an anti-cancer carrier was examined through different in vivo and in vitro analyses including small animal body imaging, the MTT viability assay and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biodegradable structure of samples was also investigated in various environments similar to the human body. Furthermore, in vitro analyses on Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells provided evidence for the multiple anti-cancer performances of the carrier. Based on the obtained results, this novel drug carrier with outstanding properties can perform an effective and obvious roll in the cancer-therapy field.","4525":"A facile pure sulfur electrode strategy is demonstrated to increase the areal loading of blade-cast sulfur electrodes and improve the electrochemical performances of thick sulfur electrodes with consideration for scale-up in practical, commercial applications. Benefiting from the unique pure sulfur electrode and an upper current collector design, the pure sulfur electrode displays low polarization, high sulfur utilization, and promising cycling stability even with an ultrahigh sulfur loading. A high areal capacity of 19.2 mAh cm(-2) has been achieved, which is the highest areal capacity for the reported blade-cast sulfur electrodes and 4 times higher than that of available lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of large-sized sulfur particles only slightly decreases the rate of conversion from S-8 to S-4(2-) during the initial discharge and has negligible impact on subsequent electrochemical performance.","296":"The application of bioactive lutein in the food industry is limited because of its poor water-solubility, instability, and low bioavailability. Nano-sized ferritin and chitosan provide a platform for fabricating shell-core system to encapsulate lutein. Herein, soybean seed ferritin (Glycine max) and chitosan stabilized lutein composites (FCLs) were fabricated by a unique reversible disassembly-reassembly character of apoferritin and ferritin-chitosan interaction. Results showed that lutein molecules were successfully encapsulated within the apoferritin with a molar ratio of 25.2 to 1 (lutein\/ferritin), and the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were 16.8% and 2.50% (w\/w), respectively. It was calculated that approximately 10 chitosan molecules were bound to a ferritin with a binding constant of 6.3 x 10(5) M-1, suggesting electrostatic interaction played an important role in ferritin-chitosan interaction. Results also indicated as much as 74.1% (w\/w) of lutein was retained in FCLs after storage at 20 degrees C for 7 days. In addition, the photo-and heat-stability of lutein in FCLs were greatly improved as compared to free lutein. Furthermore, FCLs exhibited prolonged release of lutein in simulated gastrointestinal tract (GI) digestion as a result of ferritin coating and chitosan binding. Interestingly, food components exerted different effects in lutein release, EGCG, grape seed proanthocyanidin, and milk could inhibit while pectin could facilitate the release of lutein from FCLs. This work demonstrates an innovative strategy to solubilize, stabilize and control release of functional food nutrients.","1559":"The calculations of local reactivity descriptors, the electron donor Fukui function f(-)(r), the average local ionization energy (I) over bar (r), the Fukui function dual descriptor f((2))(r), and the electron acceptor Fukui function f(+)(r) for alpha-tocopherol, the main biologically active form of vitamin E for antioxidant reactions in phospholipid membranes, is presented. The calculations are performed at B3LYP\/6-311++G** level of theory in the gas-phase. The obtained results indicate that the most preferred sites for donating electron in a reaction with radical or oxidizing molecule are associated mostly with pi electrons above and below the aromatic part of the alpha-tocopherol chromanol ring. The most reactive sites for accepting electrons are associated with the leaving H(9) atom in the extension of the phenolic OH bond on the alpha-tocopherol chromanol ring plane, in the place where the formation of H-bond of the precursor complex between approaching reactive oxygen radical and phenolic OH group of alpha-tocopherol could be expected. The separated reactive sites in alpha-tocopherol suggest that the proton and electron, along with the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, could also be transferred to different proton and electron acceptors as in bidirectional proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. The results presented in this paper suggest that large charge redistribution and significant pi-pi interactions may be expected in antioxidant reactions of alpha-tocopherol.","3518":"The magnetostructural transition in the Mn0.96Co1.04GeB0.02 ribbon alloy was investigated. Chemical, structural, microstructural, and magnetic studies were performed on the samples which were annealed at different temperatures. The resulting samples underwent a first-order phase transition in which the characteristic structural transition temperature shows a near-linear and inversely proportional dependence to the annealing temperature. The magnetostructural transition occurs through a simultaneous ferroelastic-magnetic transition between the ferroelastic-paramagnetic and paraelastic-ferromagnetic phases. Our results suggest that the crystal structure of the hexagonal high temperature phase allows the formation of ferroelastic domains, and the domain walls act as the natural nucleation site of the low temperature paraelastic-ferromagnetic phase.

NaTi2(PO4)(3) (denoted as NTP) is a superior anode material for NIBs. However, the poor electrochemical performance of NTP resulting from the low electronic conductivity prevents its application. Here, NTP nanoparticles embedded in carbon network (denoted as NTP\/C) were fabricated using a simple soft-template method. This anode material exhibits superior electrochemical performance when used as anode electrodes for NIBs, including highly reversible capacity (108 mAh g(-1) at 100 C) for excellent rate performance and long cycle life (83 mAh g(-1) at 50 C after 6000 cycles). The excellent sodium storage property can be resulted from the synergistic effects of nanosized NTP, thinner carbon shell and the interconnected carbon network, leading to the low charge transfer resistance, the large surface area for electrolyte to soak in and enough void to buffer the volume variation during the repeated cycle.","5773":"A prerequisite for the development of photocatalytic application is to obtain efficient and easily recycled visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalysts. Usually, nanosized photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic performances but cannot be easily recycled, and film-shaped nanostructured photocatalysts on substrates (or magnetic photocatalysts) can be easily recycled but have low surface area and\/or high production cost. To solve this problem, herein we report on the design and preparation of nonwoven cloth based on semiconductor-semiconductor (Fe2O3-AgBr as the model) nanojunctions as efficient and easily recyclable macroscale photocatalysts with nanostructure. Fe2O3-AgBr nonwoven cloth has been prepared by a simple electrospinning-calcination method. Such macroscale cloth is freestanding and it consists of hierarchical pores with diameters of 600-750 nm and nanofibers with diameters of 150-350 nm. Furthermore, these nanofibers are constructed from Fe2O3 and AgBr nanoparticles with diameters of similar to 60 nm. In addition, Fe2O3-AgBr nonwoven cloth has magnetic properties and a broadened visible-light photo-response range (400-750 nm). Under the irradiation of visible light, Fe2O3-AgBr nonwoven cloth exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than Fe2O3 nonwoven cloth and AgBr nonwoven cloth containing the same weight of visible-light-active component, for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and parachlorophenol (4-CP). Higher photocatalytic activity of Fe2O3-AgBr nonwoven cloth should result from the synergic effects between Fe2O3 and AgBr due to the broadening photoabsorption and the energy level matching. Importantly, Fe2O3-AgBr nonwoven cloth can be easily transferred and\/or recycled by the dipping\/pulling method and\/or external magnetic field, and it has excellent photocatalytic stability during recycling tests. Therefore, this work provides some insight into the design and development of novel, efficient and easily recyclable macroscale nonwoven cloths, for future practical photocatalytic application, for example, degrading organic pollutants in polluted rivers.","100":"Electric arc furnace (EAF) slags are by-products of a widespread steelmaking process. The recycling of these materials as artificial aggregates in different road applications is a well established practice, which has allowed to reduce the consumption of natural resources and to minimize waste production and costs of landfilling. However, these aggregates are still underutilized in cement-treated materials (CTMs), which consist of mixtures of aggregates blended with small amounts of cement and water that harden after compaction to form a strong paving material. In the light of these considerations, different cement-treated materials, each containing different percentages of natural and artificial aggregates were analyzed. After a preliminary characterization of chemical, physical and durability properties of EAF slag aggregates, a mix design procedure based on both moisture-density approach (gyratory compactor) and mechanical testing (unconfined compression test and indirect tensile test) was performed to identify the optimum cement and water content of CTMs. The design mixtures were then subjected to 5 different accelerated aging procedures in order to study the influence of some factors (temperature, pressure and humidity) on the durability of the cement-treated materials. The results highlighted how the EAF slags represent suitable aggregates for cement-treated materials. The use of these aggregates produced a greater compaction difficulty, but guaranteed excellent mechanical performances, above all in terms of indirect tensile strength. The durability analysis demonstrated that the recycled mixtures showed a worse behavior than the reference one, composed only by limestone aggregates. However, if correctly designed, balancing the percentage of natural aggregate replacement, these mixtures could represent suitable and durable solution for base and sub-base pavement layers.

Currently over 80% of the world's energy requirements are supplied by the combustion of fossil fuels, which promotes global warming and has deleterious effects on our environment. Moreover, fossil fuels are non-renewable energy and will eventually be exhausted due to the high consumption rate. A new type of alternative energy that is clean, renewable and inexpensive is urgently needed. Several candidates are currently available such as hydraulic power, wind force and nuclear power. Solar energy is particularly attractive because it is essentially clean and inexhaustible. A year's worth of sunlight would provide more than 100 times the energy of the world's entire known fossil fuel reserves. Photocatalysis and photovoltaics are two of the most important routes for the utilization of solar energy. However, environmental protection is also critical to realize a sustainable future, and water pollution is a serious problem of current society. Photocatalysis is also an essential route for the degradation of organic dyes in wastewater. A type of compound with the defined structure of perovskite (ABX3) was observed to play important roles in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. These materials can be used as photocatalysts for water splitting reaction for hydrogen production and photo-degradation of organic dyes in wastewater as well as for photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells and light absorbers in perovskite-based solar cells for electricity generation. In this review paper, the recent progress of perovskites for applications in these fields is comprehensively summarized. A description of the basic principles of the water splitting reaction, photo-degradation of organic dyes and solar cells as well as the requirements for efficient photocatalysts is first provided. Then, emphasis is placed on the designation and strategies for perovskite catalysts to improve their photocatalytic activity and\/or light adsorption capability. Comments on current and future challenges are also provided. The main purpose of this review paper is to provide a current summary of recent progress in perovskite materials for use in these important areas and to provide some useful guidelines for future development in these hot research areas.","5682":"In this study, we used mercerized cotton fibers as carbonization precursors to fabricate carbon materials having different structures. The morphologies of the synthesized carbon materials were successfully controlled by varying the mercerization time. Twisted ribbon-like carbon structures, carbon microtubes, and carbon rods could be synthesized by carbonizing non-mercerized cotton fibers, cotton fibers mercerized for 40 min, and fully mercerized cotton fibers (i.e., fibers mercerized for 60 min), respectively. Interestingly, along with the morphological changes, the specific surface areas of these carbon materials were also changed to 203.7, 726, and 276.7 m(2)\/g, respectively. This method of fabricating carbon materials should lead to the synthesis of novel, structured carbon materials with various functionalities as it exploits both the natural structure of cotton fibers and artificial chemical processes.

While it has been experimentally observed that enhanced fields can significantly boost SHG, to date it proved difficult to probe electrical and magnetic resonance in one and the same nanostructure. This however is necessary to directly compare relative contributions of electrical and magnetic components of SHG enhancement. In this paper we report an experimental study of a metasurface capable of providing electrical and magnetic resonant SHG enhancement for TM polarization. Our metasurface could be engineered such that the peak frequencies of electrical and magnetic resonances could be adjusted independently. We used this feature to distinguish their relative contributions. Experimentally it was observed that the magnetic resonance provides only 50% as much enhancement to SHG as compared to the electric resonance. In addition aligning both resonances in frequency results in conversion efficiency of 1.32 x 10(-10).

The beads were formed because of the existence of hemimicelles in pecursor solution. The formation of hemimicelles was attributed to the synergy of tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Abundant In3+ ions were drawn toward the ketonic oxygen of PVP resulting in In3+ ions aggregation. Compared with pristine In2O3 nanofibers (INFs), the as-prepared TINFs exhibited excellent properties for sensing NO2 gas at room temperature (25 degrees C). The enhanced sensing property was due to much absorbed oxygen and Schottky junctions between the porous single crystal In2O3 beads and the Au electrode of the sensor. The strategy for combining the unique In2O3 beads@TiO2-In2O3 nanofibers structure which possessed superior conductivity and sufficient electrons with the addition of TiO2 offered an innovation to enhance the gas sensing performance.","7488":"Carrier-based immobilization has been developed to enhance enzymatic stability and activity, which permits the employment of enzymes in different solvents, at wide ranges of pH and temperature as well as high substrate concentrations. In this study, a novel carrier was prepared with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and layered double hydroxide (LDH) via a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process followed by an in situ growth technique. The in situ growth of LDH nanoplatelets on a HNTs support was demonstrated producing a well-defined three-dimensional architecture (HNTs@LDH). These flowerlike structural materials possess a high lysozyme immobilized amount (237.6 mg\/g support) compared with individual HNTs and LDH. And such lysozyme immobilized composites (HNT@LDH-Ly) exhibit a superior antibacterial property against Escherichia coli (E. coli).","1915":"Many chemical and biological processes involve the transfer of both protons and electrons. The complex mechanistic details of these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions require independent control of both electron and proton transfer. In this report, we make use of lipid-modified electrodes to modulate proton transport to a Cu-based catalyst that facilitates the O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), a PCET process important in fuel cells and O-2 reduction enzymes. By quantitatively controlling the kinetics of proton transport to the catalyst, we demonstrate that undesired side products such as H2O2 and O-2(-) arise from a mismatch between proton and electron transfer rates. Whereas fast proton kinetics induce H2O2 formation and sluggish proton flux produces O-2(-), proton transfer rates commensurate with O-O bond breaking rates ensure that only the desired H2O product forms. This fundamental insight aids in the development of a comprehensive framework for understanding the ORR and PCET processes in general.","4552":"Ovarian Cancer (OC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated death among women. The underlying biochemical cause of OC proliferation is usually attributed to the over-expression of Chondroitin Sulphate Proteoglycans (CSPGs) wherein the CS-E subgroup plays a major role in tumor cell proliferation by over-expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hereby hypothesize that by targeting the OC extracellular matrix using a CS-E-specific antibody, GD3G7, we could provide spatial delivery of crosslinkers and anti-VEGF agents to firstly induce in vivo crosslinking and complexation (arresting) of CS-E into a biogel mass for efficient and effective detection, detachment and reduction of tumorous tissue, and secondly inhibit angiogenesis in OC. It is further proposed that the antibody-assisted targeted delivery of CS-E crosslinkers can bind to highly anionic CS-E to form a polyelectrolyte complex to inhibit the formation of ovarian tumor spheroids that are responsible for spheroid-induced mesothelial clearance and progression of OC. The hypothesis also describes the potential in vivo On-The-Spot CSPG crosslinkers such as sodium trimetaphosphate (physical crosslinker), 1,12-diaminododecane (chemical crosslinker), poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (synthetic polymer), and chitosan (natural polyelectrolyte-forming agent). In conclusion, this hypothesis proposes in vivo spatial crosslinking of CSPGs as a potential theranostic intervention strategy for OCa first in the field of cancer research.","7332":"A polymer\/surfactant association is a cooperative phenomenon in which the surfactant binds to the polymer in the form of aggregates, usually through electrostatic or hydrophobic forces. As is already known, polyelectrolytes may interact with oppositely charged surfactants through electrostatic attraction that results in polymer\/surfactant complex formation. This behavior could be desirable in wide range of application of polymer\/surfactant mixtures, such as improving colloid stability, gelling, emulsification and microencapsulation. In the present study, surface tension, turbidity, viscosity and electrophoretic mobility measurements were used to investigate the interactions of the cationic polyelectrolyte chitosan (Ch) and the oppositely charged anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in buffered water. Obtained results show the presence of interactions that lead to Ch\/SDS complexes formation at all investigated pH and for all investigated polymer concentrations. Mechanisms of interaction, as well as characteristics of formed Ch\/SDS complexes, are highly dependent on their mass ratio in the mixtures, while pH has no significant influence.","6213":"Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) can be primed for biomedical applications through functionalization with peptide coatings. Often anchored by thiol groups, such peptide coronae not only serve as passivators but can also endow AuNCs with additional bioactive properties. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure of a tridecapeptide-coated Au-25 cluster and its subsequent interactions with the enzyme thioredoxin reductase 1, TrxR1. We find that, in isolation, both the distribution and conformation of the coating peptides fluctuate considerably. When the coated AuNC is placed around TrxR1, however, the motion of the highly charged peptide coating (+5e\/peptide) is quickly biased by electrostatic attraction to the protein; the asymmetric coating acts to guide the nanocluster's diffusion toward the enzythe's negatively charged active site. After the AuNC comes into contact with TrxR1, its peptide corona spreads over the protein surface to facilitate stable binding with protein. Though individual salt bridge interactions between the tridecapeptides and TrxR1 are transient in nature, the cooperative binding of the peptide-coated AuNC is very stable, overall. Interestingly, the biased corona peptide motion, the spreading and the cooperation between peptide extensions observed in AuNC binding are reminiscent of bacterial stimulus-driven approaching and adhesion mechanisms mediated by cilia. The prevailing AuNC binding mode we characterize also satisfies a notable hydrophobic interaction seen in the association of thioredoxin to TrxR1, providing a possible explanation for the AuNC binding specificity observed in experiments. Our simulations thus suggest this peptide-coated AuNC serves as an adept thioredoxin mimic that extends an array of auxiliary structural components capable of enhancing interactions with the target protein in question.","346":"A bioinspired, membrane-based hair cell sensor consists of a planar lipid bilayer formed between two lipid-coated water droplets that connect to an artificial hair. This assembly enables motion of the hair caused by mechanical stimuli to vibrate the bilayer and produce a capacitive current. In this work, the mechanoelectrical transduction mechanism and sensing performance is experimentally characterized for a more-durable, revised hair cell embodiment that includes a cantilevered hair rooted firmly in the surrounding solid substrate. Specifically, this study demonstrates that the revised membrane-based hair cell sensor produces higher time rates of change in capacitance (0.8-6.0 nF s(-1)) in response to airflow across the hair compared to the original sensor (45-60 pF s(-1)) that did not feature a cantilevered hair. The 10-fold to 100-fold increase in the time rate change of capacitance corresponds to greater membrane bending and, thus, higher sensing currents. Membranes in the revised sensor exhibit changes in area due to bending on the order of 0.2-2.0%, versus 0.02% for the original sensor. Experiments also reveal that the bilayer displays highest sensitivity to mechanical perturbations normal to the plane of the bilayer, a membrane can transduce hair motion at frequencies below the hair's characteristic frequency, and bilayers formed between polymerized hydrogel volumes exhibit a higher sensing currents than those formed between liquid aqueous volumes. Finally, measurements of sensitivity (5-35 pA m(-1) s(-1)) and minimum (4.0-0.6 m s(-1)) and maximum (28-13 m s(-1)) sensing thresholds to airflow are performed for the first time, and we observe maximum electrical power (similar to 65 pW) in the membrane occurs for combinations of slower airflow and higher voltage. These results highlight that along with the dimensions of the hair and the compositions of the aqueous volumes, sensing performance can be tuned with applied voltage.","1297":"In this paper, the NixZn(1-x)Fe2O4 (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8) ferrite nanofibers were synthesized by electrospinning method. The microstructure, electromagnetic properties and microwave absorption mechanisms were analyzed (in detail). The results indicated that the nanofiber diameter, the saturation magnetization, the coercivity and the electromagnetic properties could be optimized by tuning the Ni2+ content. The Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite nanofiber finally performed the excellent microwave absorption properties. The reflection loss was less than -10 dB in the whole X-band frequencies. The analysis of microwave absorption mechanism indicated that the microwave absorption bandwidth was mainly depended on the input impedance matching, the enhanced electromagnetic loss properties ensured that the entering wave could be mostly absorbed, and the frequency appearing the reflection loss peak was determined by the absorber thickness.

The fabrication process consists of two redox reactions: (i) the oxidizing polymerization of PEDOT on LVO nanosheets to form a conformal coating (LVO\\PEDOT); and (ii) the reduction of KMnO4 by PEDOT to generate [MO nanoplates that stacked onto the LVO\\PEDOT (LVO\\PEDOT\\LMO). This approach to the fabrication of a complex structure eliminates the use of any extra toxic oxidizing\/reducing agents. Using LVO aerogel as the starting material, the total reaction time can be as short as 10 min. Asymmetric supercapacitors built from LVO\\PEDOT\\LMO cathode and active carbon (AC) anode (LVO\\PEDOT\\LMOIIAC) using Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte showed an energy density of 39.2 Wh kg(-1) (based on active materials), which is among the highest reported for supercapacitors with neutral aqueous electrolytes. The LVO \\PEDOT\\LMOIIAC supercapacitors also offered high rate capability (21.7 Wh kg(-1) at 2.2 kW kg(-1)) and good cycle stability (93.5% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles). These results demonstrate that the green tandem redox reaction strategy is promising for the development of complex nanocomposite materials for advanced energy storage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

And Starch-g-PNIAPM with improved graft ratio and controlled length of graft chains were obtained. The effects of molar ratio of monomer to initiator and temperature on polymerization were investigated. The thermal responsibilities investigated by H-1 NMR and UV showed that the LCST ranged from 31.5 degrees C to 23 degrees C with the increase of the length of PNIPAM chains and the concentrations of copolymers. Starch-g-PNIPAM hydrogels were gained when adding N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide as crosslinking agent and the swelling and deswelling behaviors were also investigated. The obtained hydrogels possess a high equilibrium swelling ratio as high as 1826%, and an extremely rapid shrinking rate as fast as losing more than 85% of water in 5 min.","681":"Carbon inverse opal monoliths store energy, sense small molecules, and catalyse reactions, but can be limited by their rigid form because it prevents the mechanical flexure that would be needed to embed this material within devices that bend during use. We report a method that uses carbon fiber papers to impart partial mechanical flexibility and greater electronic conductivity to carbon inverse opals. Our approach deposits colloidal crystals between the fibers in carbon fiber paper and uses the colloidal crystal templates to form inverse opal carbon from phenolic resin. The resulting carbon inverse opal papers (CIOPs) comprise both three-dimensionally interconnected macropores and aperiodic meso- and micropores, the combination of which establishes hundreds of square meters of interfacial area per gram that can store and discharge electrochemical capacitance while planar, while flexed around radii of curvature as small as 5 mm, and after 150 reversible flexures. Carbon inverse opal papers offer at least 3 times greater electronic conductivity than reported carbon inverse opals because the network of carbon fibers doubly serves as pliable framework and conductive conduit.","1512":"In the present work a detailed study of new bacteriostatic copolymers with quaternized ammonium groups introduced in the polymer chain through covalent attachment or electrostatic interaction, was performed. Different copolymers have been considered since beside the active species, the hydrophobic\/hydrophilic nature of the co-monomer was also evaluated in the case of covalently attached bacteriostatic groups, aiming at achieving permanent antibacterial activity. Homopolymers with quaternized ammonium\/phosphonium groups were also tested for comparison reasons. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized polymers after 3 and 24 h of exposure at 4 and 22 degrees C was investigated on cultures of Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus, E. faecalis) bacteria. It was found that the combination of the hydrophilic monomer acrylic acid (AA), at low contents, with the covalently attached bacteriostatic group vinyl benzyl dimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (VBCHAM) in the copolymer P(AA-co-VBCHAM88), resulted in a high bacteriostatic activity against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis (6 log reduction in certain cases). Moreover, the combination of covalently attached VBCHAM units with electrostatically bound cetyltrimethylammonium 4-styrene sulfonate (SSAmC16) units in the P(SSAmC16-co-VBCHAMx) copolymers led to efficient antimicrobial materials, especially against Gram-positive bacteria, where a log reduction between 4.9 and 6.2 was verified. These materials remain remarkably efficient even when they are incorporated in polysulfone membranes.","2943":"With the aim of understanding the basis for the high rate of hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) from dihydroanthracene (DHA) by the complex LCuOH (1; L = N,N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide), the bond dissociation enthalpy of the reaction product LCu(H2O) (2) was determined through measurement of its pKa and E1\/2 in THF solution. In so doing, an equilibrium between 2 and LCu(THF) was characterized by UV-vis and EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). A high pKa of 18.8 +\/- 1.8 and a low E1\/2 of -0.074 V vs Fc\/Fc+ in THF combined to yield an O-H BDE for 2 of 90 +\/- 3 kcal mol(-1) that is large relative to values for most transition metal oxo\/hydroxo complexes. By taking advantage of the increased stability of 1 observed in 1,2-difluorobenzene (DFB) solvent, the kinetics of the reactions of 1 with a range of substrates with varying BDE values for their C-H bonds were measured. The oxidizing power of 1 was revealed through the accelerated decay of 1 in the presence of the substrates, including THF (BDE = 92 kcal mol(-1)) and cyclohexane (BDE = 99 kcal mol(-1)). CV experiments in THF solvent showed that 1 reacted with THF via rate-determining attack at the THF C-H(D) bonds with a kinetic isotope effect of 10.2. Analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic data provides new insights into the basis for the high reactivity of 1 and the possible involvement of species like 1 in oxidation catalysis.","1952":"Carbon-fluorine (CmFn) groups were selectively introduced on the surface of natural and synthetic graphites through plasma-fluorination using C4F8 vacuum plasma treatment. The type of carbon-fluorine bondings on the plasma-fluorinated graphite surface were selectively controlled by adjusting plasma processing time from 10 to 20 min. Systematic surface analyses revealed that the fluorine amount on the surface of plasma-fluorinated graphite was determined by the type of intrinsic structure and degree of graphitization of graphite. The electronegative semi-ionic carbon-fluorine groups on the graphite surface reduced the resistance related to lithium ion migration and charge transfer, leading to highest discharge capacity of 387 mA h\/g at 1st cycle and discharge capacity of 293 mA h\/g at high 10 C rate without deteriorating the 1st cycle Coulombic efficiency. This novel vacuum plasma treatment of introducing highly electronegative CmFn species on graphite can illuminate a new route of preparing superior lithium ion battery anode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The traditional OER catalysts, such as IrO2, RuO2 and their binary or ternary oxides, have finite large-scale commercial applications due to their significant cost and rareness. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized cry-Ir by doping Ir into non-OER active cryptomelane-type manganese oxide to significantly reduce the Ir mass ratio by 60.3% from 85.7% in IrO2 to 34% in the developed catalyst, along with higher OER performance with a lower onset potential and 10 times higher specific mass activity. The special tunnel structure of cryptomelane plays an important role in promoting its OER activity through facilitating water molecular insertion into the tunnel. We combined Raman, XPS and TEM mapping to confirm that no IrO2 composite is present on the cry-Ir surface. The XPS and XAS spectra indicate substitution of Ir4+ on the Mn3+ site and the presence of more 5d states in the Ir site compared to IrO2. The differences in VBS spectra between cry-Ir, IrO2 and cry-Mn indicate that the electronic structure of Ir sites is modified when Ir substitutes Mn3+ sites. Thus, this special tunnel structure and modified Ir electronic structure in cry-Ir are responsible for the outstanding OER performance. Our studies provide an approach for designing effective Ir-based OER catalysts whilst significantly reducing the consumption of precious elements.","4787":"HYDROGELS based on acrylamide and sodium acrylate have been prepared by the chemical initiation and gamma radiation methods. The chemical method was used in presence of ammonium persulfate at 30 degrees C, whereas, the gamma irradiation method was used in presence of triethanolamine at 1KGy. The complexed hydrogels were tested for the adsorption of metal ions, e. g. (Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+). Factors affecting metal ions adsorption by the gel namely, metal ion concentrations, and time of immersion were studied. The physical properties of the complexed gel namely U. V. -reflectance, X-ray diffraction, together with its thermal stability were studied. The scanning electron micrographs showed that the hydrogel has a great ability to adsorb metal ions in the following order Mn2+> Cu2+> Fe2+. Release of metals from the complexed gel was investigated. Results showed that, the hydrogel prepared by gamma radiation has a greater tendency towards metal adsorption than the one prepared by chemical initiation.","4305":"A colloidal gold immunochromatographic signal-amplifying test strip with a sandwich format was successfully developed to detect Escherichia coli O157:H7. The detection signal was improved by addition of enhancers (HAuCl4 and NH2OH center dot HCl) to the nitrocellulose membrane of a conventional immunochromatographic strip. The detection sensitivities of the test strip before and after signal amplification were 4 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1), respectively, as determined by a colloidal gold strip reader. An 8-fold increase in sensitivity after signal amplification was accomplished within 20 min. No cross-reactivity with 27 non-target strains was observed, and the time for detecting E. coli O157:H7 in spiked milk samples was shortened by 1.5 h. The colloidal gold immunochromatographic signal-amplifying test strip thus provides a novel method for determining E. coli O157:H7 and is rapid, sensitive, convenient, and suitable for on-site detection.","3358":"Herein, we report the in situ synthesis of dual-component poly(AM-co-NVP) and poly(HEA-co-NVP) polymers (AM = acrylamide, HEA = 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, NVP = 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) based on two incompatible phases via laser-ignited inhomogeneous biphase frontal polymerization (FP) within 10 min. Once initiated, the monomers converted to polymers spontaneously without the need for any external energy owing to the traits of exothermic polymerization, providing a facile, rapid and cost-effective approach. The dependence of the frontal velocities and temperatures on initiator concentration and the monomer weight ratio was systematically investigated. Moreover, an operable bilayer film with two fluorescent signals was obtained by simply introducing fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) and quantum dots (QDs). The as-prepared fluorescent bilayer film realized white light emission and could be conveniently applied onto a commercial UV light-emitting diode (LED) to generate white LEDs. We believe the methodology developed in this work may promote the development of various inhomogeneous multicomponent polymers and LED nanocomposites in a fast and efficient way.","6267":"Fire source distinction is useful in reducing the occurrence of false alarms and in choosing an effective fire extinguishing medium. This study was aimed at distinguishing fire sources through a smoke analysis. For this purpose, a smoke detection chamber was created, which was equipped with one light source and several light sensors for enabling simultaneous detection of light extinction and scattering, respectively. The test fires considered in this study had two kinds of sources: single fire source (paper, wood, and flammable liquid) and mixed fire source (paper-wood, paper-flammable liquid, and wood-flammable liquid mixtures). The amounts of extinction and scattering for each fire were measured experimentally, and the discrete probability distributions were calculated from the measured scattering amount. The optical characteristics of each fire were obtained using extinction data and the calculated probability distributions. These optical characteristics were then used for learning of neural networks, and the learned neural networks were used to distinguish fire sources from smoke generated in the case of both single fires and mixed fires. Results revealed that the neural networks could precisely distinguish fire sources on the basis of the smoke particles in the case of both single fires and mixed fires. The results of this study are expected to be useful in developing an advanced smoke detector that can distinguish fire sources in addition to detecting smoke.","1894":"ZnO is one of the materials of choice as anode for lithium batteries, due to its high theoretical capacity, natural abundance, low toxicity, and low cost. At present, however, its industrial exploitation is impeded by massive capacity fading, and by cycling instability due to the drastic volume expansions during the electrochemical lithiation\/delithiation process. Herein, we present a novel graphite coated-ZnO anode for LiBs based on films of nanosheets, coated with graphite. The electrode is obtained by a simple and inexpensive solution hydrothermal synthesis, whereas the graphite is deposited by thermal evaporation, which is easier to perform than a wet chemistry technique. Our approach leads to a substantial increase of the permanent specific capacity, obtaining values of 600 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at a high specific current of 1 Ag-1. This represents the best performance for long-cycled, ZnO-based anodes obtained so far. Such result derives from the peculiar porous structure of the nanosheets film (pore diameter < 1 nm), as well as by the graphite coating that works as a dimensional buffer and preserves its morphology during cycling. This appears a very promising strategy for designing more stable ZnO-based anodes for Li batteries and microbatteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One dimensional nanofibers (50-250 nm diameter) of the Li[Ni0.5Mn1.5]O-4 were prepared by a single spinneret electrospinning and their performance was compared with powders synthesized via a conventional solid state approach. Li-diffusion coefficient of electrospun fibers was an order of magnitude higher (5.8 x 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1)) than that of conventional powders (1.22 x 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1)). Galvanostatic studies revealed a much improved capacity and rate performance for electrospun fibers. The fibers delivered a reversible capacity of similar to 87 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 1C rate compared to negligible capacity for solid-state prepared material. Finally, the performance of this nanostructured spinel phase as an anode in aqueous rechargeable Li-ion system was demonstrated to require a strongly alkaline electrolyte. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Multilayer magnetic gelatin membrane scaffolds with intrinsic magnetic gradients were designed to encapsulate magnetized bioagents under an externally applied magnetic field for use in magnetic-field-assisted tissue engineering. The temperature of the individual membranes increased up to 43.7 degrees C under an applied oscillating magnetic field for 70 s by magnetic hyperthermia, enabling the possibility of inducing a thermal gradient inside the final 3D multilayer magnetic scaffolds. On the basis of finite element method simulations, magnetic gelatin membranes with different concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles were assembled into 3D multilayered scaffolds. A magnetic-gradient-controlled distribution of magnetically labeled stem cells was demonstrated in vitro. This magnetic biomaterial-magnetic cell strategy can be expanded to a number of different magnetic biomaterials for various tissue engineering applications.","2963":"Biophotovoltaics has emerged as a promising technology for generating renewable energy because it relies on living organisms as inexpensive, self-repairing, and readily available catalysts to produce electricity from an abundant resource: sunlight. The efficiency of biophotovoltaic cells, however, has remained significantly lower than that achievable through synthetic materials. Here, a platform is devised to harness the large power densities afforded by miniaturized geometries. To this effect, a soft-lithography approach is developed for the fabrication of microfluidic biophotovoltaic devices that do not require membranes or mediators. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells are injected and allowed to settle on the anode, permitting the physical proximity between cells and electrode required for mediator-free operation. Power densities of above 100 mW m(-2) are demonstrated for a chlorophyll concentration of 100 M under white light, which is a high value for biophotovoltaic devices without extrinsic supply of additional energy.","5571":"Mercury contaminated drinking water significantly affects the central nervous system, kidneys and other organs in humans even at very low concentration. Higher concentration of mercury are reported to be effectively removed by adsorption and precipitation techniques. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a better known technique used for the removal of low concentration of Hg (<200 ppb). However, its limitations include low flux, high water rejection, high capital cost, in addition to being power dependent. The present study reports the fabrication of low cost, biodegradable, electrospun cerium functionalized PVA-chitosan (Ce-PVA-CHT) composite nanofibers for the effective removal of low concentrations of Hg(II) present in water. It adsorbs Hg(II) and purifies water up to safe potable limits as prescribed by WHO\/US-EPA. The adsorption of Hg(II) over the surface of Ce-PVA-CHT is confirmed by SEM\/EDAX, FTIR, XRD and XPS techniques. The adsorption studies are reported by varying parameters, viz. time, pH, adsorbent dose and varying contents of Ce in PVA-CHT nanofibers. Traceability is established by using SCP Science-U.K. made certified reference standard for the calibration of AAS-HG used for the determination of Hg(II). The kinetic data shows fast and efficient removal of Hg(II) and indicates to follow pseudo second order kinetics. The adsorption data is best fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and indicates monolayer adsorption of Hg(II).","2815":"The objective of this experimental study is to produce a nanofibrous membrane functionalized with adsorbent particles called metal organic framework (MOF) in order to adsorb CO2 from a gas source. Therefore, Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was chosen as the precursor for nanofibers and HKUST-1, a Cu-based MOF, was chosen as adsorbent. The experimental process consists of electrospinning PAN solution blended with HKUST-1 to produce a nanofibrous mat as working substrates. The fibers were collected in a cylindrical canister model. SEM image of this mat showed nanofibers with the presence of small adsorbent particles, impregnated into the as-spun fibers discretely. To increase the amount of MOF particles for effectual gas adsorption, a secondary solvothermal process of producing MOF particles on the fibers was required. This process consists of multiple growth cycles of HKUST-1 particles by using a sol-gel precursor. SEM images showed uniform distribution of porous MOF particles of 2-4 A mu m in size on the fiber surface. Energy dispersive spectroscopy report of the fiber confirmed the presence of MOF particles through the identification of characteristic Copper elemental peaks of HKUST-1. To determine the thermal stability of the fibrous membrane, Thermogravimetric analysis of HKUST-1 consisting of PAN fiber was performed where a total weight loss of 40% between 210 and 360 A degrees C was observed, hence proving the high-temperature durability of the synthesized membrane. BET surface area of the fiber membrane was measured as 540.73 m(2)\/g. The fiber membrane was then placed into an experimental test bench containing a mixed gas inflow of CO2 and N-2. Using non-dispersive infrared CO2 sensors connected to the inlet and outlet port of the bench, significant reduction of CO2 in concentration was measured. Comparative IR spectroscopic analysis between the gas-treated and gas untreated fiber samples showed the presence of characteristic peak in the vicinity of 2300 and 2400 cm(-1) which verifies the adsorption of CO2.","2415":"In this paper, the cobalt zinc ferrite was prepared by coprecipitation method at different pH conditions. The influence of pH values on the coprecipitation reaction was theoretically analyzed at first. The calculated results showed that the pH values should be controlled in the range of 9-11 to form the stable precipitation. The XRD investigation was used to further confirm the formation of the composite on specific pH values. In addition, the morphological study revealed that the average particle size of the composite decreased from 40 nm to 30 nm when the pH value increased from 9-11. The variation of microstructure plays a critical role in controlling the electromagnetic properties. From the electromagnetic analysis, the dielectric loss factor was 0.02-0.07 and magnetic loss factor was 0.2-0.5 for the composite synthesized at pH of 9, which presents dramatically improved dielectric loss and magnetic loss properties than the samples prepared at pH of 10 and 11.

In this study, a D-glucose dehydrogenase was purified from the industrial 2KGlcA producer Arthrobacter globiformis C224. After four purification steps, the GlcDH was successfully purified over 180 folds and specific activity of 88.1 U\/mg. A single protein band of 87 kDa was detected by SDS-PAGE. The purified GlcDH had the broad substrate specificity with the K-m values for D-glucose, D-xylose, D-galactose and maltose of 0.21 mM, 0.34 mM, 0.46 mM and 0.59 mM, respectively. The kinetic studies proved that A. globiformis GlcDH followed the ping-pong kinetic mechanism. The GlcDH showed an optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 45cC with the stable activity at temperature of 20-40 degrees C and pH of 6.0-7.0. Organic solvents, metal ions or EDTA could significantly influence the GlcDH activity to different degrees.","1193":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to be considered as an emerging detection technique for cell tracking experiments to evaluate the fate of transplanted progenitor cells and develop successful cell therapies for tissue engineering. Adipose tissue engineering using adipose tissue derived progenitor cells has been advocated for the cure of soft tissue defects or for persistent soft tissue augmentation. Adipose tissue derived progenitor cells were differentiated into the adipogenic lineage and labeled with two different types of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in varying concentrations which resulted in a concentration dependent reduction of gene expression of adipogenic differentiation markers, adiponectin and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), whereas the metabolic activity was not altered. As a result, only low nanoparticle concentrations for labeling were used for in vivo experiments. Cells were seeded onto collagen scaffolds and subcutaneously implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. At 24 h as well as 28 clays after implantation, MRI analyses were performed visualizing nanoparticle-labeled cells using T2-weighted sequences. The quantification of absolute volume of the scaffolds revealed a decrease of volume over time in all experimental groups.

When subjected to a mild physical stress, curcumin is observed to internalize within the micellar hydrophobic core of oleic acid sophorolipid resulting in the formation of curcumin-sophorolipid nanoconjugates (CurSL). These bio-composites show enhanced retention time and increased bioavailability of curcumin in rat models. In the presence of gold salts, CurSL act as potent reducing and capping agents, resulting in the synthesis of monodispersed, spherical gold nanoparticles (CurSL-GNPs) of 8-10 nm in size. Physicochemical, morphological and optical characteristics of both the nanoparticles are discussed based on spectroscopic absorption, photoluminescence (PL), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, SEM and TEM measurements. FTIR spectroscopy signatures of these nanoparticles confirm the retention of functional groups in the end products. A retention time of 2 hours in blood plasma and an increase in curcumin recovery by about 150 times that previously reported were observed in the pharmacokinetic (pK(a)) studies performed on Wistar rats. The bio-distribution of gold nanoparticles in rats was studied using EDX, which revealed their presence in different vital organs. The absence of unusual legions or necrosis in histopathological analysis of vital organs in all the rat models suggests the use of curcuminsophorolipid nano-conjugates enhances curcumin bioavailability and the Cur-SL based nano-gold formulation is a good drug delivery carrier.","84":"Pumpkin has been employed for the first time as a renewable, low-cost precursor for the preparation of porous carbon materials with excellent performance. Unlike most other precursors, pumpkin is rich in sugars and starch, and it has advantageous properties for large-scale production. The as-prepared materials adopted a unique morphology that consisted of numerous fused sphere-like carbon grains with a high specific surface area (2968m(2)g(-1)), abundant micro and mesopores, and excellent electrochemical properties. The pumpkin-derived activated carbon (PAC) material not only exhibited a high specific capacitance of 419Fg(-1), but also showed considerable cycling stability, with 93.6% retention after 10000cycles. Moreover, a symmetrical supercapacitor that was based on PAC showed a high energy density of 22.1Whkg(-1) in aqueous electrolyte. These superior properties demonstrate that PAC holds great promise for applications in electrochemical energy-storage devices.","5473":"Different components and well-defined structures may cooperatively improve the performances of composite materials and enhance their applicability. In this paper, core-shell alpha-Fe2O3@NiO nanofibers (alpha-Fe2O3@NiO CSNFs) with hollow nanostructures are synthesized by a facile coaxial electrospinning method and calcination procedure. Considering the temperature-dependent solute degradation process and different influencing factors including the solvent evaporation rate and phase separation, a multistage formation mechanism has been proposed to understand the formation of the CSNF structure. The gas sensing tests indicate that the alpha-Fe2O3@NiO CSNFs exhibit significantly improved gas sensitivity and selectivity performances in comparison with NiO hollow nanofibers (NiO HNFs) and alpha-Fe2O3 nanofibers (alpha-Fe2O3 NFs). The response of alpha-Fe2O3@NiO CSNFs to 50 ppm HCHO at 240 degrees C is similar to 12.8, which is 10- and 7.1-times higher than those of pure NiO and a-Fe2O3, respectively. The synergy between the heterojunction, core-shell hollow nanofiber structure and Fe loading into the NiO shell contribute to the enhanced response of alpha-Fe2O3@NiO CSNFs. Moreover, extremely fast response-recovery behavior (similar to 2 s and similar to 9 s) has been observed at the optimal working temperature of 240 degrees C. The detection limit for HCHO could be lower than 1 ppm. These favorable gas sensing performances make the alpha-Fe2O3@NiO CSNFs promising materials for gas sensors.","2465":"Developing nanofiber mats with unique three-dimensional morphology (3D) are of great interest to biomedical engineers working on nanotechnology. Herein, we report cellulose acetate nanofiber mat with honeycomb-like surface structure for the very first time. Cellulose acetate nanofiber mats (CANFs) were prepared via a simple electrospinning technique. A new and straightforward oil spray method was developed to create the honeycomb like structure on the nanofiber mats. The patterned structure of the prepared nanofiber mat (hs-CANF5) was investigated. The diameter of the honeycombs created on the nanofiber mat ranged from 150 mu m to 450 mu m. XRD data revealed the amorphous nature of the prepared CANFs and hs-CANFs. The structure of the nanofiber mat was also studied by FT-IR analysis.

However, realizing high capacitance and excellent rate capability remains a critical challenge. Herein, a three-dimensional carbon support of cellulose-fiber covered with graphene (CFG) to induce the growth of a hierarchical nanostructured Ni(OH)(2) (Ni(OH)(2)-CFG) is fabricated through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction without using any surfactants or hard templates. The resulting Ni(OH)(2)-CFG composite exhibits a special vertical and cross-linked network structure with a large surface area (425.9 m(2) g(-1), higher than that of unsupported Ni(OH)(2), 366.9 m(2) g(-1)) and appropriate pore size distribution of micro-mesopores, which offer fast electrolyte ion-transport and short ion-diffusion pathways. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the Ni(OH)(2)-CFG composite as a binder-free electrode reveals high mass capacitance (2276 F g(-1), at 1 A g(-1)), good rate capability and excellent cycling stability (no capacitance decay after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g(-1)). In addition, an asymmetric Ni(OH)(2)-CFG\/\/activated carbon supercapacitor exhibits a high cell-voltage of 1.6 V and a maximum specific capacitance of 191.3 F g(-1) with an energy density up to 15.0 W h kg(-1). The excellent performances of the Ni(OH)(2)-CFG composite demonstrate its promising potential for future capacitor based energy storage and conversion.","1446":"In this work, nine homologous ion-pair amphiphiles (IPAs) were successfully prepared by the precipitation or ion-exchange methods. This demonstrated the feasibility of designing and synthesizing lipid-like amphiphiles from cheap and abundant single-chained cationic and anionic amphiphiles. The thermotropic transition behavior from gel phase (L beta) through rippled phase (P-beta') to liquid-crystalline phase (L-alpha) of these IPA bilayers in water was thereafter systematically studied by using differential scanning calorimetry. A database of pretransition temperature, main transition temperature, and the corresponding transition enthalpy\/entropy of the nine IPA bilayers was documented. Different phase transition behavior is exhibited by IPA bilayers with different hydrocarbon chain lengths and symmetry. The main phase transition temperature (T-m) is consistently higher for IPAs with higher total number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chains. For IPAs with the same total number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chains, the T-m is higher for the symmetric one than that of the asymmetric one. Furthermore, much higher T-m was exhibited by IPA as compared with that of phosphatidylcholine based on the same total number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chains. These fundamental properties of IPAs definitely help understand membrane characteristics of catanionic vesicles, which were fabricated from IPAs, for potential applications in drug delivery and gene therapy.","5652":"We here present studies of electrochemical doping of poly(1-aminoanthraquinone) (PAAQ) films with three structurally different phenolic acids. The examined phenolic acids (sinapic, ferulic and syringic acid) were selected due to their resemblance to redox active groups, which can be found in lignin. The outstanding electrochemical stability of PAAQ films synthesized for this work enabled extensive cycling of phenolic acid-doped PAAQ films. Potentiodynamic and charge discharge studies revealed that phenolic acid-doped PAAQ films exhibited enhanced capacitance in comparison to undoped PAAQ films, together with appearance of redox activity characteristics specific for each dopant. Electrochemical kinetic studies performed on microelectrodes affirmed the fast electron transfer for hydroquinone-to-quinone reactions with these phenolic compounds. These results imply the potential application of phenolic acids in cheap and degradable energy storage devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Wound healing practice is deliberated a constant morphological modification of cells with the alteration of cell exodus, adherence, etc. In this characteristic, the advance of polymeric nanofiber scaffolds with together biodegradable and electrically conducting properties would be pronounced benefits in the biomedical field. Here it has been established the conducting polymer and biopolymer based electrospun nanofiber membranes exploited on wound healing and wound-size decline in rats successfully. Methods: Ultrafine conducting polyaniline with o-aminobenzenesulfonic acid copolymer (PAni-co-PABSA) and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)\/chitosan oligossacaride (COS) biopolymers based electrospun nanofiber membranes have been exploited for wound healing applications. The nanofiber membranes were assembled by spawning double full-thickness skin wounds on the dorsum of SD rats. Results: The current study is commenced to appraise the potentials for use of PAni-co-PABSA\/PVA\/COS electrospun nanofibers in wound healing in rats. The nanofiber membranes cured wounds show considerable lesser provocative responses throughout the experimental period. Area of nanofiber membranes and commercial (Fucidin (R)) ointment treated wounds are significantly decreased equate to control cured wounds. After 15 days treatment, the histological appearance by nanofiber membranes reveal almost complete healing and intensification in collagen and granulation as compare to control one. Conclusion: The nanofiber membranes cured wounds have ample reduced inflammatory responses throughout the experimental period. Histological appearance after two weeks of management with PAni-co-PABSA\/PVA\/COS nanofiber reveals almost complete healing and an increase in collagen and granulation as compare to control.","3717":"Recent trends in electrochemical immunoassays have paved the way for metal nanoparticles bursting as a very promising technique for sensitive evaluation. In this work, we report the competence of bioconjugated CdTe quantum dot (QD) and gold nanoparticle (GNP) for the detection of Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen of Salmonella Typhi. The QD and GNP were bioconjugated with anti-Vi antibody and characterized to quantify the loading of respective nanoparticles. Cadmium chloride and gold chloride reference standards were used for the evaluation of the respective metal atoms in the nanobioprobes. The bursting of QD and GNP released 6.91 nmol of cadmium and 83.21 nmol of gold ions in 1 mL each, whereas, the anti-Vi nanobioprobe bursting resulted in the release of 17.29 nmol of cadmium and similar to 34.75 nmol of gold atoms per 1 mu g of antibody. The results are indicative of conjugation of multiple QDs per antibody molecule in marked contrast to the GNPs which can interact and bind with many antibodies owing to its larger size. CdTe-IgG nanobioprobe was, therefore, made use for developing a new sandwich type stripping voltammetry immunoassay in the presence of polymyxin B, a cationic receptor molecule, as a capture molecule. The stripping response observed was much convincing in the range 1 ng to 625 ng of Vi antigen indicating feasibility and reliability of the QD based stripping assay. The results provided an insight into the governing factors of immunostripping inferring the potency of biofunctionalized semiconductor\/inorganic nanodots for electroanalytical applications.","4447":"The performance and microbial community of an anoxic-aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating mariculture wastewater were evaluated at different oxytetracycline (OTC) concentrations. The COD and nitrogen removal efficiencies decreased with the increase in OTC concentration from 0 to 12 mg L-1. No apparent NO3--N accumulation was found during the whole operational period, whereas NO2--N accumulation occurred at 12 mg L-1 OTC. The specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), specific ammonium oxidation rate (SAOR), specific nitrite oxidation rate (SNOR) and specific nitrate reduction rate (SNRR) decreased with increasing influent OTC concentration. The protein (PN) and polysaccharide (PS) contents in the loosely-bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) increased with the increase in OTC concentration from 0 to 12 mg L-1, respectively. The appearance of OTC in the influent could obviously affect the functional groups of the PN and PS in the LB-EPS and TB-EPS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) illustrated that amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the EPS might be involved in the interaction between the EPS and OTC. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile indicated that some variations were found in the microbial community of the activated sludge with increasing OTC concentration. Some microorganisms were depleted or weakened with the increase in OTC concentration, whereas others became the predominant microorganisms due to their ability to adapt to the OTC toxicity.","2850":"Carbonaceous porous matrices were prepared from a tannin-based resin by physical foaming, having improved thermal properties by addition of various kinds and various amounts of graphite fillers. The resultant composite carbon foams presented much higher thermal conductivity, making them suitable for hosting phase-change materials with the aim of using them in seasonal storage applications. These materials were investigated in terms of porous structure, thermal and mechanical properties. It was shown that, unlike what was a priori expected, smaller particles were far more suitable for getting conductive, strong and porous matrices. The smaller were the particles, the better were the results. These findings were explained and justified, making such biomass-based composite carbon foams interesting and cheap candidates for thermal storage applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a facile electrochemical oxidation strategy is described to construct a nickel sulfide\/oxide heterostructure which enhances the specific areal capacitance of Ni3S2 electrodeposited on nickel foam. The resulting heterostructure electrode exhibits high areal capacitance, 65 times that of the as-prepared Ni3S2 electrode (2035 mF cm(-2) vs. 31 mF cm(-2) at a current density of 8 mA cm (2)), while still maintaining great stability, showing no performance degradation after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Its exceptional capacitance, advanced rate capability, and superior cycling stability are attributed to the transformed composition and unique nanostructure achieved during electrochemical oxidation, which can provide a large electrochemically active surface area, fast electron\/electrolyte ion transport, and robust structural stability. Such a low-cost and facile strategy can be potentially applicable to prepare many other materials for supercapacitor applications.","6417":"A simple and novel treatment methodology is introduced to produce PVDF-based thin-film composite forward osmosis (TFC-FO) electrospun membranes for enhanced desalination performance. The proposed treatment strategy is based on improving the surface properties of the PVDF electrospun nanofiber support layer using triethylamine (TEA). The results indicated that this strategy enhanced the interfacial polymerization step by overcoming the hydrophobicity feature dilemma of the PVDF support layer. As an FO membrane, the characterization of the modified membrane shows a distinct decrease in the structure parameter of the support layer by 67%, which mitigates the adverse effect of the internal concentration polarization (ICP) by 45%. Moreover, the performance of the modified TFC-FO membrane exhibited a high water flux, approximately 68 LMH and low reverse salt flux, about 2 g m(-2) h(-1) at 2 M NaCl draw solution, with >99.5% salt rejection. Overall, the introduced modification technique has the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to implement, and appropriate for commercial membranes.","5544":"Performance and cost of anodes are two important aspects limiting the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for practical applications. Novel three-dimensional (3D) open-celled carbon scaffold (CS and CS-GR) anodes were prepared by carbonizing the microcellular polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN\/graphite composites (PAN-GR), which were obtained by means of foaming by using supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) as a physical foaming agent. The two anodes as well as the conventional carbon felt anode were assembled in MFCs based on Escherichia coli (E. coli). The improved performance of the CS anode is ascribed to the remaining -C=N group resulting in considerably improved hydrophilicity and biocompatibility after carbonization and the 3D open-celled scaffold structure contributing to the substrate transfer and internal colonization of E. coli bacteria. Meanwhile, the superior performance of the CS-GR anode is mainly attributed to the increased specific surface area and active reaction area resulting from the addition of graphite. This work provides an effective method to develop a 3D open-celled biocompatible CS-GR anode, which facilitates the extracellular electron transfer for high-performance MFCs that are promising for practical applications on a large scale.","5466":"Lignin utilization during biomass conversion has been a major challenge for lignocellulosic biofuel. In particular, the conversion of lignin along with carbohydrate for fungible fuels and chemicals will both improve the overall carbon efficiency and reduce the need for chemical pretreatments. However, few biomass-converting microorganisms have the capacity to degrade all cell wall components including lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. We hereby evaluated a unique oleaginous fungus strain, Cunninghamella echinulata FR3, for its capacity to degrade lignin during biomass conversion to lipid, and the potential to carry out consolidated fermentation without chemical pretreatment, especially when combined with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) bmr mutants with reduced lignin content. The study clearly showed that lignin was consumed together with carbohydrate during biomass conversion for all sorghum samples, which indicates that this organism has the potential for biomass conversion without chemical pretreatment. Even though dilute acid pretreatment of biomass resulted in more weight loss during fungal fermentation than untreated biomass, the lipid yields were comparable for untreated bmr6\/bmr12 double mutant and dilute acid-pretreated wild-type biomass samples. The mechanisms for lignin degradation in oleaginous fungi were further elucidated through transcriptomics and chemical analysis. The studies showed that in C. echinulata FR3, the Fenton reaction may play an important role in lignin degradation. This discovery is among the first to show that a mechanism for lignin degradation similar to those found in white and brown rot basidiomycetous fungi exists in an oleaginous fungus. This study suggests that oleaginous fungi such as C. echinulata FR3 can be employed for complete biomass utilization in a consolidated platform without chemical pretreatment or can be used to convert lignin waste into lipids.","3197":"A unique hierarchically nanostructured composite of iron oxide\/carbon (Fe3O4\/C) nanospheres-doped three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel has been fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal strategy. In this novel nanostructured composite aerogel, uniform Fe3O4 nanocrystals (5-10nm) are individually embedded in carbon nanospheres (ca. 50nm) forming a pomegranate-like structure. The carbon matrix suppresses the aggregation of Fe3O4 nanocrystals, avoids direct exposure of the encapsulated Fe3O4 to the electrolyte, and buffers the volume expansion. Meanwhile, the interconnected 3D graphene aerogel further serves to reinforce the structure of the Fe3O4\/C nanospheres and enhances the electrical conductivity of the overall electrode. Therefore, the carbon matrix and the interconnected graphene network entrap the Fe3O4 nanocrystals such that their electrochemical function is retained even after fracture. This novel hierarchical aerogel structure delivers a long-term stability of 634mAhg(-1) over 1000 cycles at a high current density of 6Ag(-1) (7C), and an excellent rate capability of 413mAhg(-1) at 10Ag(-1) (11C), thus exhibiting great potential as an anode composite structure for durable high-rate lithium-ion batteries.","6186":"The direct carbothermic reduction process from high-purity silica is promising for next-generation low-cost silicon solar cells. In this process, the granulation process is essential to avoid blowout of the silica powder. In this study, we investigated the effect of binders on this reduction process using four kinds of binders. The real-time monitoring of the chamber pressure and quadrupole mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the sign of the blowout phenomena of the generated CO gas and decomposition gas of the binders. In the case of starch and sucrose, the strengths of granules were not enough to the process with the pressure of the generated CO gas, while the granules with enough strength, namely, the ones with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), resulted in silicon yield of 33.8% and 27.8%, respectively.","4522":"Biopolymer nanocomposite is a class of material which exhibits superior properties compared to pure biopolymer and conventional composites. Addition of nanofillers to the pure biopolymers which results in nanocomposites improves the dielectric, UV absorption, conductivity and other mechanical properties. In this work, ZnO nano particles (NPs) reinforced (5% to 10%) poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) [P (3HB)] films were synthesized and the effect of ZnO NPs on the dielectric and UV absorption properties were studied. Compared to virgin polymer, ZnO NPs reinforced P (3HB) composites showed significant improvement in the relative permittivity with loss tangent (tan delta) < 0.02, especially 10% ZnO NPs reinforced P (3HB) composite film has permittivity value of (epsilon') similar to 4.03 which is nearly equal to that of FR4 (epsilon' - 4.8). UV-Vis spectroscopy study revealed the absorbance behaviour of ZnO NPs reinforced P (3HB) composites and observed high values in the UV region (UV-B and UV-C) which is suitable for LED encapsulation. Moreover, the increased transmittance was noticed in the visible region. From the above observations, it is suggested to use ZnO NPs reinforced P (3HB) composites with suitable resin for LED encapsulation applications and also as a UV-blocker for future UV free LEDs.","7064":"Burrs are formed in mechanical processes such as cutting and blanking, and can have a number of negative effects, such as reducing product life. Burr removal generally depends on manual treatment methods due to the various shapes and properties of burrs. Deburring is therefore considered a significant issue in terms of achieving efficient production and automation. Electrochemical machining (ECM) is commonly used in the deburring of internal cross holes because of its high efficiency and lack of surface residual stresses. However, in the electrochemical deburring process, stray corrosion may cause loss of machining precision and surface quality. We herein propose a localized electrochemical deburring process using a gelatinous electrolyte to solve the problem of stray corrosion. As the gelatinous electrolyte is in contact with the burr surface without macroscopic liquid flow, electrochemical corrosion is confined to the narrow bounds of the burr. Our results indicate that the proposed process can maintain the original machined precision and surface quality while preventing stray corrosion, which is not possible using traditional ECM.","3504":"Given their competitive prospects for energy storage, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted ever-intensive research interest. However, the large volume changes during cycling and structural pulverization significantly hinder the cycling stability and high capacity for lithium-alloy electrodes. Herein, novel one-dimensional (1D) hollow core shell SnO2\/C fibers were synthesized by facile coaxial electrospinning. The as-prepared fibers that possess sufficient hollow voids and nanosized SnO2 particles on the inner shell are able to serve as an anode in LIBs. The results suggest a reversible capacity of 1002 mAh g(-1) (for the initial cycle at 100 mA g(-1)), excellent rate capability, and a highly stable cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 833 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 600 mA g(-1). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique hollow core-shell structure, which offers sufficient voids for alleviating the volume changes of SnO2 nanoparticles during lithiation\/delithiation processes. The promising strategies and associated opportunities here demonstrate great potential in the fabrication of advanced anode materials for long-life LIBs.","1149":"One-dimensional SnO2-TiO2 composites were prepared via emulsion electrospinning process.

It should be ascribed to the novel structure, which could separate the electrons and holes effectively.","1375":"Superior green algal cells showing high lipid production and rapid growth rate are considered as an alternative for the next generation green energy resources. To achieve the biomass based energy generation, transformed microalgae with superlative properties should be developed through genetic engineering. Contrary to the normal cells, microalgae have rigid cell walls, so that target gene delivery into cells is challengeable. In this study, we report a ZnO nanowire-incorporated microdevice for a high throughput microalgal transformation. The proposed microdevice was equipped with not only a ZnO nanowire in the microchannel for gene delivery into cells but also a pneumatic poIydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microvalve to modulate the cellular attachment and detachment from the nanowire. As a model, hygromycin B resistance gene cassette (Hyg3) was functionalized on the hydrothermally grown ZnO nanowires through a disulfide bond and released into green algal cells, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, by reductive cleavage. During Hyg3 gene delivery, a monolithic PDMS membrane was bent down, so that algal cells were pushed down toward ZnO nanowires. The supply of vacuum in the pneumatic line made the PDMS membrane bend up, enabling the gene delivered algal cells to be recovered from the outlet of the microchannel. We successfully confirmed Hyg3 gene integrated in microalgae by amplifying the inserted gene through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The efficiency of the gene delivery to algal cells using the ZnO nanowire-incorporated microdevice was 6.52 X 10(4)- and 9.66 X 10(4)-fold higher than that of a traditional glass bead beating and electroporation.","5487":"To further illustrate the influence of different additives on the electrochemical performance of CoO composite-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries, a CoO\/carbon nanofiber composite-based electrode has been constructed and its electrochemical performances are investigated in detail in 1 M LiPF6-EC\/DMC (1 : 1, v\/v) electrolyte with different additives, i.e., vinylene carbonate, ethylene sulfite, lithium bisoxalatoborate, Li2CO3 and K2CO3. The results show that additional electrolyte additives have a great effect on the initial efficiency and capacity retention of CoO-based anodes. For example, better cyclic performance is produced in the presence of vinylene carbonate. The addition of Li2CO3 can accelerate the conductivity of lithium-ions, and improve greatly the initial efficiency, charge\/discharge capacity and cycling performance as well. On adding Li2CO3, the initial efficiency increases from 75.1% to 81% and its reversible capacity can remain at 850 mA h g(-1) stably even after 100 cycles. The action mechanism of the SEI film between Li2CO3 additive and CoO composite anodes has been confirmed too.","1487":"Durability assessment of materials exposed to natural weathering requires accelerated testing for verification of the ultraviolet (UV) stability, especially for polymeric material. The type approval testing of photovoltaic (PV) modules according to the standards International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 and IEC 61646 includes a so-called UV-preconditioning test with a total UV dose of 15 kWh\/m(2) corresponding to natural weathering of about 3 months only. A serious UV test representing the service life needs to apply a much stronger UV-intensity in a comparable way. Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems performed an inter-laboratory comparison of UV-light sources in 13 accredited test labs and test centres of major PV module manufacturers. The most important topic was the spectral radiometric measurement of the used UV sources. Another main issue was the comparison with the integral measurements by the sensors used for control of the tests. Errors up to 120% were found.

This is achieved using a short (1-5 mm) etching and simultaneous micronanotexturing process, followed by a fast thermal annealing step, which induces accelerated hydrophobic recovery while preserving important chemical functionality created by the plasma. Surface-bound biomolecules resist harsh washing with sodium dodecyl sulfate and other detergents even at elevated temperatures, losing less than 40% of the biomolecules bound even at the harshest washing conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance are used to unveil the chemical modification of the plasma-treated and stabilized surfaces. The: nanotextured and chemically stabilized surfaces are used as substrates for the development of immunochemical assays for the sensitive detection of C-reactive protein and salmonella lipopolysacchatides through immobilization of the respective analyte-specific antibodies onto them. Such substrates are stable for a period of 1 year with ambient storage.","6634":"Nitrogen-doped carbon with a high surface area was prepared by the one-step pyrolysis of cellulose paper under NH3 gas, and has been developed as an alternative to Pt\/C for the oxygen reduction reaction in microbial fuel cells (MFCs).The electrochemical tests showed that the catalytic performance of N-doped carbon in neutral media was significantly better than that of undoped carbon, with an onset of 0.21V. The maximum power density of MFCs with the N-doped carbon catalyst (1041 +\/- 90mWm(-2)) was much higher than that of Pt\/C-based MFC (584 +\/- 10mWm(-2)), while the cost was significantly lower. These results demonstrated that such N-doped carbon has the advantages of low cost and high efficiency, and can be a promising alternative to Pt\/C in large-scale applications of MFCs.","1509":"Natural fibers are attracting the interest of engineering sectors owing to specific advantages such as lightweight and lower cost as well as an inherent condition of being renewable, biodegradable, recyclable and environmentally correct with respect to CO2 emission. In addition, several natural fibers present mechanical and thermal properties appropriate for engineering applications. The fiber extracted from the stem of the banana plant is nowadays recognized by its mechanical properties. However, some thermal properties of the banana fibers have not yet been fully investigated.

The development of efficient, cost effective, and environmentally friendly natural polymer-based adsorbents is reported here. Magnetic chitosan (CS) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMC) nanocomposites have been synthesized by a simple one-step chemical coprecipitation method. The nanoparticles were assessed for the removal of Pb2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ ions from aqueous solution. Kinetic and thermodynamic models were used to describe and understand the adsorption process of the ions onto the nanomaterials. The interactions between the ions and the biopolymer-based composites are reversible, which means that the nanoparticles can be regenerated in weakly acidic or EDTA containing solution without losing their activity and stability for water cleanup applications.","2177":"Nitrogen-doped graphene decorated by iron-nickel alloy is introduced as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.

Under physiological conditions, the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ROS scavenging is tightly controlled. As part of normal cellular metabolism, regulated oxidative stress is responsible for a variety of cellular responses. Excess generation of ROS that could not be compensated by antioxidant system has been suggested to be responsible for a number of pathological conditions. Due to their short biological half-lives, direct measurement of ROS is not available and surrogate measures are commonly used. Plasma lipoproteins, by virtue of their close interactions with endothelial cells in the vasculature and the susceptibility of their surface lipids to oxidative modification, are perfect biological sensors of oxidative stress in the arterial wall. In particular, with each consumed meal, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, secreted by the intestine into the circulation, are responsible for the delivery of 20-40 grams of fat to the peripheral tissues. This flux of dietary lipids is accompanied by concomitant increases in glucose, insulin and other meal-associated metabolites. The contribution of postprandial lipemia to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has been previously suggested by several lines of investigation. We have extended this hypothesis by demonstrating the acute generation of oxidative epitopes on plasma lipoproteins as well as transient changes in the oxidative susceptibility of plasma lipoproteins.","4808":"Carbothermal reduction could be employed as a facile technology for the synthesis of various novel materials, especially transition-metal-functionalized nanostructures. In particular, energy materials, such as ZnO, MnO2, and LiFePO4, combined with different carbon nanostructures have been widely synthesized via carbothermal reduction, which could be well established industrially due to its low-cost starting materials. In addition, a variety of carbon sources can be employed as comparatively low-cost carbon precursors for the synthesis of carbonaceous functional materials, such as porous carbon-coated magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., Co3O4@C, Fe3O4@C, and FeC3-C). These functional materials have great potential for use in energy and environmental applications. Carbothermal reduction methods possess some incomparable advantages, such as convenience, relatively low cost, and good repeatability, for commercial applications. However, they normally require a relatively high temperature for sustaining carbothermic reaction. Consequently, novel structures can also be derived from renewable, abundant carbon precursors. Examples include lignocellulosic biomass or other biological products derived from food or agricultural wastes (carbohydrates, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, chitin, inorganics, and proteins). Thermochemical conversion of biomass, including pyrolysis in an inert environment, has been developed for the production of energy and carbon materials. Furthermore, it is still a potential challenge to simultaneously produce high-quality biofuel products and synthesize value-added functionalized materials via in situ carbothermal reduction. This review will be a powerful resource for stimulating the development of sustainable metal-functionalized nanostructured materials by carbothermal reduction integrated with other advanced technologies, particularly for strengthening efforts towards novel materials for clean energy and environmental applications in the future sustainable society.","7089":"Organic aerogels generally exhibit poor thermal, mechanical and hydrophilic properties, which seriously restrict their large-scale applications. In this study, siliane was introduced into resorcinol-furfural (RF) aerogels due to the enhancement of silicone to thermal stability and hydrophobicity of polymer molecules. Resorcinol-furfural\/silicone (Si-RF) hybrid aerogels were synthesized by sol-gel polycondensation of resorcinol, furfural, (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (ATPES) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), followed by ambient pressure drying (APD). The Si-RF aerogels showed an interpenetrating framework with high mesoporosity. Silicon-containing functional groups were successfully incorporated into the RF aerogels in dehydration reactions. Surface area, characteristic thermal degradation temperature and char yield of the Si-RF aerogels are higher than that of the as-prepared RF aerogels. In order to improve the mechanical properties, carbon fabric reinforced Si-RF aerogel composites were prepared by impregnating a carbon-bonded carbon fiber (CBCF) composite with the hybrid aerogels. The obtained composites possessed a low bulk density (0.309-0.375 g cm(-3)), high compressive strength (0.759-2.940 MPa for different directions) and low thermal conductivity (0.085-0.136 W (m(-1) K-1)). Hydrophobic aerogels were also fabricated by -Si(CH3)(3) (trimethylsilyl substituent) modification via immersing fresh Si-RF aerogels in trimethylethoxysilane (TMES)\/hexane solution followed by aging and APD. The hydrophobic property was promoted by the concentrations of solutions (water contact angle of about 108-135 degrees), also the thermal stability.","5059":"Lipid-based oleaginous microorganisms are potential candidates and resources for the sustainable production of biofuels. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of several alternative bio-based solvents for extracting lipids from yeasts. We used experimental design and simulation with Hansen solubility simulations and the conductor-like screening model for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) to simulate the solubilization of lipids in each of these solvents. Lipid extracts were analyzed by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) to obtain the distribution of lipids classes and gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC\/FID) to obtain fatty acid profiles. Our aim was to correlate simulation with experimentation for extraction and solvation of lipids with bio-based solvents in order to make a preliminary evaluation for the replacement of hexane to extract lipids from microorganisms. Differences between theory and practice were noted for several solvents, such as CPME, MeTHF and ethyl acetate, which appeared to be good candidates to replace hexane.","2272":"BACKGROUNDAscomycetes are capable of considerable lignocellulose degradation. However, there is limited knowledge on the metabolic profile of their biomass degradation. Metabolomic studies are capable of providing important biochemical information to understand and characterise fungal biomass degradation mechanisms. RESULTSWinery biomass waste of Vitis vinifera var. Shiraz was subjected to Aspergillus niger mediated solid state fermentation for 8 days in (H2O)-H-2 supplemented medium. Samples were collected every 24 h, freeze-dried and derivatized before GC-MS analysis. Covariance-inverse multivariate statistics were used to classify the most significant metabolites. Metabolite-flux profiling classified 37 unique metabolites in 18 different pathways leading to or from glycolysis-tricarboxylic acid pathways. The majority of the sugars were consumed during the first 4 days; this was in order to synthesize fatty acids, amino acids and secondary metabolites. Inhibition started at day 5, as indicated by the accumulation of sugars and the plateauing of N-acetyl glucosamine (a major fungal cell wall component). CONCLUSIONSA 4-day continuous yeast or mixed fungal fermentation will not only prevent product inhibition, but it will also aid in generating bio-ethanol. Inducing 2-keto-acid decarboxylases followed alcohol dehydrogenases at the onset of inhibition is predicted to aid in the generation of butanol isomers, which are considered valuable sources of fuel.

The cleavage behavior and the single crystal structure of MnTeMoO6 crystal were analyzed. The total charge density of MnTeMoO6 was calculated. Cleavage behavior analysis indicates that a perfect cleavage behavior with {001} planes was found in MnTeMoO6 crystal. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the MnTeMoO6 single crystal crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal space group P 4(4) over bar 42(1)m (No. 113) with cell parameters a=5.269(3) angstrom, c=9.014(11) angstrom and Z=2, and exhibits a novel neutral two-dimensional layered structure consisting of asymmetric MnO4 tetrahedra, TeO4 polyhedra and MoO4 tetrahedra. The total charge density analysis indicates that these layers are held together by van der Waals forces and the natural cleavage planes lie between the two proximate neutral layers. The results show that the layered structure connected by the weak van der Waals forces is the original of the cleavage in MnTeMoO6 crystal, and MnTeMoO6 crystal can be made into micro nonlinear optical device by stripping the cleavage layers.

However, wide-range adoption of HPC for practical application is largely shadowed by its extremely complex synthesis process with considerably low production efficiency. Herein we reported a simple template-free, one-step sintering method, to massively produce the HPCs for high-performance EDLCs. Resorting to the 3D structure modification of the wide pore size distribution, high surface area of HPCs (up to 3000 m(2) g(-1)) was achieved. By using 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte, the as-fabricated HPCs based EDLCs can be operated reversibly over a wide voltage window of 1.6 V with superior specific capacitance of 240 F g(-1) under a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). In the meanwhile, the EDLCs exhibit excellent rate capability (high power density of 16 kW kg(-1) at 10.2 Wh kg(-1)) and long-term cycling stability with 9% loss of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. This output performance distinguished itself among most of the carbon-based EDLCs with neutral aqueous electrolyte. Thus, the template-free one-step sintering method produced HPCs for EDLCs represents a new approach for high-performance energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Spherical CaCO3 particles with six smooth facets symmetrically distributed on the surface were prepared and systemically characterized by means of TEM, SEM, XRD, Raman, TGA, and FTIR. Time-resolved experiments showed the spherical calcite crystals were transformed from amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) in the early stage and underwent a dissolution-recrystallization process in the later stage. For BaCO3, dumbbell shaped crystals that were formed by the dendritic aggregation of rod like subunits with six sides were generated. Both the morphologies of CaCO3 and BaCO3 crystals could be effectively tuned by changing the crystallization time and concentration of PMPC. Finally, a possible crystallization mechanism for the formation of CaCO3 and BaCO3 particles under the control of PMPC was proposed based on the experiments.","6266":"The NIST Firebrand Generator (NIST Dragon) has been used to quantify the vulnerability of structures to ignition by firebrand attack. The Firebrand Generator is a useful device to study firebrand transport, and has been used to validate transport models of firebrand showers. During this series of experiments, the Firebrand Generator was fed with wood cubes of uniform size. The glowing firebrands generated were collected in an array of water-filled pans that were arranged to collect the bulk of the lofted firebrands. The pan arrangement was determined from repeated preliminary studies. These experiments were performed over a range of wind speeds (up to 9 m\/s) to determine the lofting distance. The major change in these experiments from prior work was that, for a given wind speed, the firebrand size and mass was determined at each pan location. In the past, it was only possible to determine the number distribution; specifically the number of firebrands at each spatial location was counted (not resolved at every pan but only across a given row of pans). Statistical analysis indicated that a normal distribution was able to capture the number\/mass percentage versus horizontal distance. This study provides even greater fidelity measurements to validate transport models of firebrand showers, and further insights into firebrand generation.","1886":"In recent years considerable efforts have been devoted to utilize DNA based biomaterials for efficient sensor design. The polymeric molecule has high aqueous solubility, thus design of any water based sensor with DNA without rigorous chemical treatment (modification for covalent bonding) is challenging. In the present work we have developed a novel silver-nanoparticle (Ag-NPs) impregnated genomic DNA-lipid (CTAB) complex, which is completely insoluble in water and forms excellent thin film on optical fiber tips. The intact structural as well as functional integrity of the genomic DNA in the thin film is found to be a key factor for its specific affinity to mercury ions in aqueous environments. We have demonstrated that a dip-coated optical fiber tip can work as a fluorescence sensor in addition to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) type absorption sensor due to nano surface energy transfer (NSET) between the DNA minor-groove binding dye 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Ag-NPs. Nanomolar, specific detection of mercury ions with few seconds reaction time is found in this versatile and economic way revealing clearly the advantageous aspects of our work.","2225":"Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are new materials for molecular identification ability with specific identification, preordainment, and wide applicability. A cholesteryl chitin carbonate (Chol-Chi) was synthesized via two steps, and its chemical structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance. The resulting Chol-Chi was used as a covalently bound template precursor for imprinting cholesterol. After this precursor was cross-linked with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, the carbonate bond in the cross-linked Chol-Chi obtained was cleaved hydrolytically to afford a guest-binding site accompanying the easy and efficient removal of a sacrificial spacer. Field emission scanning electron micrograph observation showed that the surface on MIP particles was rough and porous. The equilibrium adsorption capacity for the molecularly cholesterol-imprinted polymer (Chol-MIP) was 13.60 mg\/g, while that of the cholesterol-non-imprinted polymer (Chol-NIP) was only 4.75 mg\/g when concentrations of the MIP and NIP equaled to 20.0 mg, respectively. Reusability of Chol-MIP with negligible loss of the initial adsorption capacity was observed after five adsorption-desorption cycles. In addition, stigmasterol and estradiol were selected as competitive molecules in selectivity tests, and the MIPs showed a good specific selectivity and intense recognition of cholesterol.","1302":"Complex metal hydrides and Li ion batteries play an integral role in the pursuit of clean and sustainable energy. The former stores hydrogen and can provide a clean energy solution for the transportation industry, while the latter can store energy harnessed from the sun and the wind. However, considerable materials challenges remain in both cases, and research for finding solutions has traditionally followed parallel paths. In this Perspective, I show that there is a common link between these two seemingly disparate fields that can be unveiled by studying the electronic structure of the anions in complex metal hydrides and in electrolytes of Li ion batteries; they are both superhalogens. I demonstrate that considerable progress made in our understanding of superhalogens in the past decade can provide solutions to some of the materials challenges in both of these areas.","3121":"Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanorod arrays have been prepared via a novel templated electrodeposition process and were characterized for their photocatalytic behavior in nonaqueous photoelectrochemical cells. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod films serve as sacrificial templates for the in situ formation of polymer nanopore membranes on transparent conductive oxide substrates. Nitrocellulose and poly(lactic acid) are effective membrane-forming polymers that exhibit different modes of template formation, with nitrocellulose forming conformal coatings on the ZnO surface while poly(lactic acid) acts as an amorphous pore-filling material. Robust template formation is sensitive to the seeding method used to prepare the precursor ZnO nanorod films. Photoelectrochemical cells prepared from electrodeposited Cu2O films using methyl viologen as a redox shuttle in acetonitrile electrolyte exhibit significant charge recombination that can be partially suppressed by a combination of surface passivation methods. Surface-passivated nanostructured Cu2O films show enhanced photocurrent relative to planar electrodeposited Cu2O films of similar thickness. We have obtained the highest photocurrent ever reported for electrodeposited Cu2O in a nonaqueous photoelectrochemical cell.","7219":"Single-layer thin alignment films of dye molecules are of growing importance, particularly for state-of-the-art LCD technology. Here we show that a sequential process involving the photoalignment and humidification of a chromonic liquid crystalline azobenzene (brilliant yellow; BY) dispersed in a triacetyl cellulose (TAC) matrix gives a thin alignment film with an exceptionally high order parameter (0.81). Spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses of a BY\/TAC composite film in each alignment process revealed that brief humidification triggers restructuring of the BY assembly from 1D nematic-like order to anisotropic 2D columnar order, resulting in the dramatic increase in the order parameter.","6422":"A laboratory based integrated approach was undertaken for improvement of lipid accumulation in green microalgae under sodium chloride (NaCl) stress. The maximum biomass yields (1.22 +\/- 0.04 g L-1 in Chlorella and 1.31 +\/- 0.04 g L-1 in Chlorococcum) were obtained in the media with initial NaCl concentrations at 2 g L-1 (for Chlorella) and 0.05 g L-1 (for Chlorococcum) after 14 days of culture. Interestingly, maximum lipid accumulation obtained was 45.8 +\/- 0.4% w\/v for Chlorella (on day eight) and 36.33 +\/- 0.56% w\/v for Chlorococcum (on day ten) at an exposure of 5 g L-1 and 1.5 g L-1 NaCl concentrations, respectively. Fatty acid profiles of methyl esters for neutral and polar lipid fractions showed the presence of myristic (C14: 0), palmitic (C16: 0), palmitoleic (C16: 1), oleic (C18: 1) and linoleic (C18: 2) acids as major fatty acids. Fluorescence intensities (% positive Nile red stained cells) of neutral and polar lipid fractions were also higher in NaCl stress conditions. A significant correlation between polar lipid and neutral lipid was found in both Chlorella (r(2) = 0.979) and Chlorococcum (r(2) = 0.972). Flow cytometric study demonstrated a positive fluorescence signal for neutral and polar lipid bodies related to Nile red fluorescence. Associated biochemical changes, like those in total chlorophyll, carotenoid, carbohydrate and protein contents, were determined under variable NaCl concentrations. The elemental compositions (CHNS) and CO2 fixation rate were assessed using high lipid yielding cells under optimum NaCl concentrations. Biodiesel fuel properties were obtained from high lipid yielding cells of the test microalgae and compared with Indian and international diesel standards. Finally large-scale cultivation of Chlorella ellipsoidea was performed in a hybrid photobioreactor (800 L capacity) and the highest biomass and lipid content obtained was 1.66 +\/- 0.09 g L-1 (at 8 days) and 54.73 +\/- 1.78% w\/v (at 10 days) at 5 g L-1 NaCl respectively. This optimized NaCl concentration makes it an economical substitute for biodiesel production on a large scale.","5103":"The design and control of molecular systems that self-assemble spontaneously and exclusively at or near an interface represents a real scientific challenge. We present here a new concept, an active seed layer that allows to overcome this challenge. It is based on enzyme-assisted self-assembly. An enzyme, alkaline phosphatase, which transforms an original peptide, Fmoc-FFY(PO42-), into an efficient gelation agent by dephosphorylation, is embedded in a polyelectrolyte multilayer and constitutes the \"reaction motor\". A seed layer composed of a polyelectrolyte covalently modified by anchoring hydrogelator peptides constitutes the top of the multilayer. This layer is the nucleation site for the Fmoc-FFY peptide self-assembly. When such a film is brought in contact with a Fmoc-FFY-(PO42-) solution, a nanofiber network starts to form almost instantaneously which extents up to several micrometers into the solution after several hours. We demonstrate that the active seed layer allows convenient control over the self-assembly kinetics and the geometric features of the fiber network simply by changing its peptide density.","2119":"Temperature variation in natural environment was conducted in order to predict the action spectrum of temperature under natural environment by substituting the model to the segmented fitting method. A novel method based on the measured data was proposed to solve the concrete thermal parameter. Results showed that the temperature variation of the concrete and natural environment periodically fluctuates, and the theoretical action and response spectra of the temperature agree well with the measured results. The presence or absence of sheltered condition has a significant effect on temperature response in concrete in terms of the amplitude, extreme value and arising time.

The as-synthesized Te@PEDOT coaxial nanocables have diameters of center cores in the range of 510 nm, and the size of the outer shell from several nanometers to 15 nm. More interestingly, the as-prepared Te@PEDOT nanocables can be converted to Pd@PEDOT nanocables via a galvanic replacement reaction. The center core of the Pd nanowire exhibits a high crystallinity. The application of the synthesized Pd@PEDOT nanocables as peroxidase-like catalysts for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 is reported. The synergistic effect between the Pd nanowire and electrically conducting PEDOT enhances the catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of H2O2. A detection limit toward H2O2 is as low as 4.83 mu M, and a linear range from 10 to 100 mu M has been achieved. This work offers a potential versatile route for the fabrication of cable-like nanocomposites with conducting polymers and other active components, which display great promise in applications such as catalysis, nanoelectronic devices, and energy storage and conversion.","812":"A series of mixed oxide nanoparticles were prepared by a coprecipitation method and characterized by many techniques. Nickel-zirconium oxide catalysts and their partially reduced magnetic counterparts were highly efficient in the direct transformation of biomass derivatives, including ethyl levulinate, fructose, glucose, cellobiose, and carboxymethyl cellulose, into -valerolactone (GVL) without the use of an external hydrogen source, producing a maximum GVL yield of 95.2% at 200 degrees C for 3h with hydrogen-reduced magnetic Zr5Ni5 nanoparticles (<20nm). The acid-base bifunctionality of these nanocatalysts plays a synergic role in the synthesis of GVL in alcohols, whereas appropriate control of the nickel\/zirconium molar ratio is able to improve the selectivity towards GVL (approximate to 98%), along with high formation rates (up to 54.9mmolg(-1)h(-1)). Moreover, the magnetic Zr5Ni5 nanoparticles were conveniently recovered by means of a magnet for five cycles with almost constant activity.","4901":"With the depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing demand of energy for economic development, it is urgent to develop renewable energy technologies to sustain the economic growth. Electrospinning is a versatile and efficient fabrication method for one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured fibers of metals, metal oxides, hydrocarbons, composites, and so forth. The resulting nanofibers (NFs) with controllable diameters ranging from nanometer to micrometer scale possess unique properties such as a high surface-area-to-volume and aspect ratio, low density, and high pore volume. These properties make 1D nanomaterials more advantageous than conventional materials in energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. In this review, the key parameters for e-spinning are discussed and the properties of electrospun NFs and applications in solar cells, fuel cells, nanogenerators, hydrogen energy harvesting and storage, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of electrospinning and an outlook on the possible future directions are also discussed.","1244":"The elusive neutral bicarbonate radical and the carbonate radical anion form an acid\/conjugate base pair. We now report experimental studies for a model of bicarbonate radical, namely, methyl carbonate (methoxycarbonyloxyl) radical, complemented by DFT computations at the CAM-B3LYP level applied to the bicarbonate radical itself. Methyl carbonate radicals were generated by UV irradiation of oxime carbonate precursors. Kinetic EPR was employed to measure rate constants and Arrhenius parameters for their dissociation to CO, and methoxyl radicals. With oleate and cholesterol lipid components, methyl carbonate radicals preferentially added to their double bonds; with linoleate and linolenate substrates, abstraction of the bis-allylic H atoms competed with addition. This contrasts with the behavior of ROS such as hydroxyl radicals that selectively abstract allylic and\/or bis-allylic H atoms. The thermodynamic and activation parameters for bicarbonate radical dissociation, obtained from DFT computations, predicted it would indeed have substantial lifetime in gas and nonpolar solvents. The acidity of bicarbonate radicals was also examined by DFT methods. A noteworthy linear relationship was discovered between the known pK(a)'s of strong acids and the computed numbers of microsolvating water molecules needed to bring about their ionization. DFT computations with bicarbonate radicals, solvated with up to eight water molecules, predicted that only five water molecules were needed to bring about its complete ionization. On comparing with the correlation, this indicated a pK(a) of about -2 units. This marks the bicarbonate radical as the strongest known carboxylic acid.","4163":"In the present work we investigate the influence of the degree of crystallinity of graphite on the production of graphite oxide (GO). Graphite precursors with varying degrees of crystallinity were produced by milling a high-purity synthetic graphite powder during different times and the milled materials were used for the synthesis of GO, using a modified Hummers method. The products were characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry, solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), elemental and textural analysis. C-13 NMR spectra revealed the presence of epoxy, hydroxyl, carbonyl and lactol groups in the oxides. However, the oxidation degree was found to be largely dependent on the milling time, with the best GO samples being produced from graphites with intermediate milling times. These results were rationalized in terms of the structural changes brought about by the milling process, as revealed by the solid-state C-13 NMR spectra and the XRD patterns obtained for the milled graphites.

Here we develop a novel binder-free Si-based anode through the encapsulation of Si nanoparticles (Si NPs) with carbon cloth and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), where carbon nanotubes (CNTs) rooted from a nickel foam result in a strong connection mechanically and electrically between active materials and current collectors. In the resulting architecture, a dense cellular carbon cloth from carbonization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on Si surfaces can improve the electrical conductivity and accommodate the volume change, whereas rGO networks provide additional mechanical strength to maintain the integrity of electrodes.

The prepared magnetic microgels as amid-mag-p(MAc-co-AN) microgel were found to be very effective adsorbents for the removal of metal ion such as Cd(II), Cr(III), and organic dyes e.g., methylene blue (MB), rhodamine 6G (R6G) and a herbicide, paraquat (PQ). A tremendous increase in the adsorption capacities of amid-p(MAc-co-AN) microgels was found as 88.1, 89.9, 190.0, 334.5 and 166.5 mg g(-1) from 40.2, 37.4, 75.3, 57.4, and 56.3 for MB, R6G, PQ, Cd(II), and Cr(III), respectively. Moreover, a further increase in adsorption capacity of amid-mag-p(MAc-co-AN) microgel composites were also accomplished with the existence of magnetic particles. Adsorption of these contaminants from tap, river and seawater was also studied. The effects of different parameters i.e., pH, concentration of adsorbent solution and amount of adsorbate was also studied.

A distinctly highest activity, paralleled by Folin-Ciocalteu data and UV-vis absorbances, was seen in the most common type of such brandy, made of plums; other samples included brandies made of apples, pears, fruit mixtures, wine, and cereals. In fact, the values seen for the plum brandy were, even before maturation with wood, similar to those of commercially-available wood-maturated whisky. Increases of up to one order of magnitude in antioxidant activity were seen in all brandies upon maturation with various types of wood - with mulberry tree by far the most efficient, followed by oak and cherry - and with lowest values seen for acacia. Attempts to identify anticancer activity in concentrated extracts prepared from plum brandy, failed.

Herein reported are new hierarchically porous coreeshell hybrids of polyaniline@multi-walled carbon nanotube (PANI@MWCNT) with ultrafine nanofiber-assembled network shell for supercapacitors via a facile reverse microemulsion polymerization route. Among various as-prepared samples, PANI@MWCNT2 hybrids (72 wt.% PANI loading) show the maximum specific capacitance of 663 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) with good capacitance retention of about 87% at 2 A g(-1) in contrast to pure PANI (526 F g(-1) with 76% retention) and other hybrids (613 and 538 F g(-1) for the hybrids with 84 wt.% and 48% wt.% PANI, respectively). Moreover, 82% of initial capacitance still remains over 1000 cycles at 5 A g(-1) for PANI@MWCNT2. The data clearly reveal a dramatic improvement of the hybrids in performance containing capacitance and rate capability meanwhile lifetime, thanks to unique structure features with highly surface-porous PANI nanofiber networks intimately wrapped around conductive MWCNTs helping to greatly promote faradic redox process and cycling behavior.

Although much work has focused on increasing the gravimetric capacitance of carbon materials, it is highly needed to obtain high volumetric capacitance for real compact device application. Therefore, a finely tuned carbon material structure with both optimal gravimetric and volumetric capacitances has been becoming a considerable challenge. In this work, we synthesized free-standing boron and oxygen co-doped carbon nanofiber (BO-CNF) films for the first time. Both high gravimetric and volumetric capacitances (192.8 F g(-1) and 179.3 F cm(-3) at 1 A g(-1)) can be obtained by an optimized design with regulating the heteroatom content and packing density. Meanwhile, the BO-CNF film with a relatively high packing density exhibits an excellent rate capability (78.5% capacitance retention from 1 to 100 A g(-1)), which is due to the formation of continuous electrolyte ion diffusion network as well as good electrical conductivity. Such BO-CNF film provides an excellent platform for depositing polyaniline active materials and the boron dopant can be recycled to reduce the cost for the possibly scalable application.

However, noble metal catalysts are most commonly used for such electrochemical hydrogen evolution making the process cost ineffective. Thereby design of hybrid catalysts with minimal use of noble metals using a suitable support material is a prime requirement for the electrolysis of water. Herein, we demonstrate the superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) supported on faceted titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals (Pt-TiO2) and nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) based TiO2 nanocomposite (Pt-TiO2-N-rGO). The ternary Pt-TiO2-N-rGO nanocomposite exhibits a superior HER activity with a small Tafel slope (similar to 32 mV.dec(-1)), exchange current density (similar to 0.22 mA.cm(-2)), and excellent mass activity (similar to 3116 mA.mg(pt)(-1)) at 300 mV overpotential. These values are better\/higher than that of several support materials investigated so far. The excellent HER activity of the ternary Pt-TiO2-N-rGO nanocomposite is ascribed to the presence of Ti(III) states and enhanced charge transportation properties of N-rGO. The present study is a step toward reliable electrochemical hydrogen production using faceted TiO2 nanocrystals as support material.","921":"Sustainable and affordable hydrogen production through splitting of water, an essential step towards renewable and clean energy storage, calls for efficient non-precious-metal catalysts to make the process economically viable.

Both molybdenum carbides on graphene hybrid materials, the MoC-G and Mo2C-G, show extraordinary high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid media. The reaction kinetics of the MoC-G and Mo2C-G were revealed. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) were conducted to study the electronic nature of MoC-G and Mo2C-G electrocatalysts to explore the electrochemical mechanism of ultrasmall multiple phases molybdenum carbides nanocrystals on graphene for hydrogen evolution reaction.","322":"Nitrogen-rich hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) were synthesized by concentric electrospinning and subsequent KCl\/ K2CO3 activation. The obtained HPCNFs have quite high nitrogen content (14.4 wt%) and rational hierarchical porous structure, thus exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 293 F g(-1), a superior specific areal capacitance of 40 RE cm(-2) at 0.2 A g(-1) and an excellent rate capability of 62.8% (185 F g(-1)) at 50 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte.","6719":"Near infrared (NIR, lambda = 700-1100 nm) laser-triggered drug delivery systems (DDs) have attracted great interest for the synergic photothermal-\/chemo-therapy of tumors, and a prerequisite for their development is to obtain biocompatible and efficient nanoplatforms that possess excellent photothermal and controllable (on\/off) drug-release abilities. Herein, we have designed and fabricated full-polymer smart nanogels (PNA-CS-PPy-DOX) as novel NIR-DDs, by using polypyrrole (PPy) as the photothermal agent, PNA-chitosan (PNA-CS) with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 42 degrees C as the carrier and the doxorubicin (DOX) as the model of the anticancer drugs. The aqueous dispersion of PNA-CS-PPy-DOX shows increased photoabsorption with a wavelength from 600 to 1100 nm. The temperature of its aqueous dispersions (PPy concentration: 1-20 mu g mL(-1)) goes up quickly from room-temperature to 32.4-60.3 degrees C in 5 min under the irradiation of a 915 nm laser (intensity: 2.0 W cm(-2)), verifying the excellent photothermal performance. To simulate the in vivo drug delivery, a typical aqueous PNA-CS-PPy-DOX (similar to 10 mg mL(-1)) dispersion is covered by chicken skin as the model of biological tissue. After the irradiation of the 915 nm laser (intensity: 2.0 W cm(-2)), the temperature of the dispersion goes up to higher than 42 degrees C (LCST of PNA-CS), resulting in the release of the drug. As a result, the cumulative release of DOX from PNA-CS-PPy-DOX increases from 1.67% (at 0 min) to 48.53% (at 14 min of irradiation), indicating the excellent intelligence and controllability. Subsequently, the PNA-CS-PPy-DOX dispersion is injected into the tumor of the mice. Under the irradiation of the 915 nm laser, the cancer cells can be efficiently destroyed, and the tumor suffers significant ablation, indicating the excellent synergic photothermal-\/chemo-therapy effects compared with the single photothermal therapy or chemotherapy effect. Therefore, the present PNA-CS-PPy-DOX nanogels have great superiority as a biocompatible and efficient nanoagent for the synergic photothermal-\/chemo-therapy of tumors.","5789":"A novel magnetic lignin composite was prepared and modified with diethylenetriamine. The properties of the composite were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, TGA and VSM. Then, the adsorption of chromium(VI) from aqueous solutions using this magnetic lignin composite was investigated. Chromium(VI) removal is pH dependent and the optimum adsorption was observed at pH 2.0. The pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model were applied to describe the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm, respectively, for the chromium(VI) adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated, which revealed the adsorption process to be spontaneous and exothermic. Regeneration of the magnetic lignin composite was achieved by using 0.4 M NaCl and 0.2 M NaOH, more than 87% efficiency retention was obtained after 5 cycles.","3045":"Polyaniline (PANI) was one of the most extensively studied adsorbents due to its low cost and good environmental stability. The objective of the current study was to improve the selective capabilities of PANI for anionic dyes. We found that the acid doped PANI prepared with hydrochloric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) could selectively adsorb anionic dyes. It exhibited very good selectivity for OG dye, the mechanism was proposed based on the chemical interaction of PANI with the sulfonate group of the dyes. The effects of solution pH, initial dye concentration, and different HCl\/PTSA mole ratios on the adsorption capacity of OG have been investigated. Kinetic simulations indicated that the adsorption process could be well represented by pseudo-second-order kinetic plots. The isothermal adsorption curve fitting also showed that the adsorption process could be well described by the Langmuir isothermal equation. The results showed that acid doped PANI could be employed as a promising adsorbent for anion removal from dye wastewater.","3832":"Magnetic nanoparticles enable an effortless catalyst recovery at the end of a chemical reaction, and therefore contribute to more sustainable and greener industrial processes. Herein we report the synthesis of magnetically retrievable Ag NPs for the catalytic hydrogenation and oxidation of aldehydes in water. Upon brief exposure to microwave irradiation, Ag and Fe3O4 NPs formed directly within carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), an inexpensive, biobased polymer support. The catalyst was tested for the hydrogenation of aldehydes in water, showing a high activity and selectivity to C=O bonds against C=C bonds. Aldehydes can also be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid with the same catalyst, even with substrates that do not self-oxidize under air. The organic matrix and the magnetic support allowed the catalyst to be recycled up to five times with negligible metal leaching in the reaction medium.","3370":"Dopamine is an excellent and flexible agent for surface coating of various materials, with the high-concentration of amine groups serving as a facile stabilizer for some metallic nanoparticles. In this work, mesoporous composites of nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) decorated with cobalt nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated via the combination of a mussel-inspired biomimetic polydopamine (PDA)-coating process using electrospun porous polystyrene fibers as templates, a simple solution deposition method and subsequent high-temperature carbonization. This rationally designed porous NCF-Co composite possesses a large surface area and numerous electrochemically active sites, which exhibits synergistically improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) with a relatively positive onset potential, large current density, as well as superior durability compared with the commercial platinum-carbon (Pt\/C) catalyst, making it a promising noble-metal-free catalyst for practical ORR applications.","5189":"Various strategies have been proposed to date in order to mitigate the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, such as the separation, storage, and utilization of this gas. Among the available technologies, the electrochemical valorisation of CO2 appears to be an innovative technology, in which electrical energy is supplied to establish a potential between two electrodes, allowing CO2 to be transformed into value-added chemicals under mild conditions. It provides a method to recycle CO2 (in a carbon neutral cycle) and, at the same time, a way to chemically store the excess of renewable energy from intermittent sources, thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Among the useful products that can be obtained, methanol is particularly interesting as a platform chemical, and it has gained renewed and growing attention in the research community. Accomplishments to date in the electroreduction of CO2 to methanol have been encouraging, although substantial advances are still needed for it to become a profitable technology able to shift society to renewable energy sources. This review presents a unified discussion of the significant work that has been published in the field of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol. It emphasizes the aspects related to process design at different levels: cathode materials, reaction media, design of electrochemical cells, as well as working conditions. It then extends the discussion to the important conclusions from different electrocatalytic routes, and recommendations for future directions to develop a catalytic system that will convert CO2 to methanol at high process efficiencies.","1737":"Biocomposite nanofiber scaffolds of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different graphene oxide (GO) concentrations were prepared using electrospinning technology. The successful incorporation of GO nanosheets into PCL polymer nanofibers improved the thermal and mechanical properties of the nanofibers because of the intrinsic properties developed due to the interactions of GO and PCL. In order to estimate the biocompatibility of PCL\/GO composite scaffolds, mouse marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) and low-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12-L) cells were cultured. Initial adhesion and spreading of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells on PCL\/GO composite scaffolds with moderate addition of GO (0.3 and 0.5 wt%) were significantly superior to those on pure PCL scaffolds, and the cells exhibited typical fibroblast- and neuron-like morphologies with obvious pseudopods and mature appearance, respectively. A small amount of GO did not restrain the proliferation and viability of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells, which indicated appreciable cell affinity of GO. Moreover, the hybridization of GO nanosheets and PCL polymer dramatically enhanced the differentiation of the mMSCs and PC12-L cells into osteo- and neuro-like cells, respectively. All these results suggest that PCL\/GO composite nanofibers could be a promising alternative material as biocompatible scaffolds for tissue engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to drive the water splitting reaction efficiently, substantial ohmic losses due to poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte should be avoided, and therefore the reaction should be carried out at an extreme electrolyte pH. Herein we demonstrate the photoelectrochemical activity of an amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) photocathode for solar hydrogen evolution using an ultrathin nickel (Ni) film coupled with a nickel molybdenum catalyst (Ni-Mo) in a highly alkaline solution (pH 14). The incorporation of the Ni film coupled with Ni-Mo nanoparticles increases the number of active sites and therefore improves the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, we report the influence of the catalyst configurations on the ohmic and solid liquid junction behavior on semiconducting interfacial layers. The a-SiC photocathode coated with the Ni\/Ni-Mo dual-catalyst produces a photocurrent density of -14 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. RHE using only cheap and abundant materials. This photocurrent is the highest recorded value from an amorphous-Si-based photocathode, and is achieved with a total film thickness of less than 150 nm.","2083":"Continuous efforts have been devoted to searching for sustainable energy resources to alleviate the upcoming energy crises. Among various types of new energy resources, solar energy has been considered as one of the most promising choices, since it is clean, sustainable, and safe. Moreover, solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy, with a total power of 173 000 terawatts striking Earth continuously. Conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, which could potentially provide continuous and flexible energy supplies, has been investigated extensively. However, the conversion efficiency is still relatively low since complicated physical, electrical, and chemical processes are involved. Therefore, carefully designed photocatalysts with a wide absorption range of solar illumination, a high conductivity for charge carriers, a small number of recombination centers, and fast surface reaction kinetics are required to achieve a high activity. This Account describes our recent efforts to enhance the utilization of charge carriers for semiconductor photocatalysts toward efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion. During photocatalytic reactions, photogenerated electrons and holes are involved in complex processes to convert solar energy into chemical energy. The initial step is the generation of charge carriers in semiconductor photocatalysts, which could be enhanced by extending the light absorption range. Integration of plasmonic materials and introduction of self-dopants have been proved to be effective methods to improve the light absorption ability of photocatalysts to produce larger amounts of photogenerated charge carriers. Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons and holes migrate to the surface. Therefore, acceleration of the transport process can result in enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency. Different strategies such as morphology control and conductivity improvement have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. Fine-tuning of the morphology of nanostructured photocatalysts can reduce the migration distance of charge carriers. Improving the conductivity of photocatalysts by using graphitic materials can also improve the transport of charge carriers. Upon charge carrier migration, electrons and holes also tend to recombine. The suppression of recombination can be achieved by constructing heterojunctions that enhance charge separation in the photocatalysts. Surface states acting as recombination centers should also be removed to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, surface reactions, which are the core chemical processes during the solar energy conversion, can be enhanced by applying cocatalysts as well as suppressing side reactions. All of these strategies have been proved to be essential for enhancing the activities of semiconductor photocatalysts. It is hoped that delicate manipulation of photogenerated charge carriers in semiconductor photocatalysts will hold the key to effective solar-to-chemical energy conversion.","7444":"In this work, two kinds of conical spinnerets, referred to as the sharp cone and blunt cone, were compared to the single needle spinneret to investigate the effect of electric field distribution on the morphology and mechanical properties of the as-prepared fibers. Based on the simulation results, polystyrene and poly(vinylidene fluoride) solutions were used in the experiments. The electric field distributions were simulated, and the jet paths were captured by a high-speed camera. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical properties of the as-prepared fibers were characterized. It was found that the as-prepared fibers' morphology induced by these different spinnerets had a significant influence on the mechanical properties. It is worth mentioning that the mechanical properties of fiber mats were improved from the sharp cone electrospinning system, which lays the foundation for the regulatory of fiber structures.","4154":"In this work, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was synthesized from the precursors of TiO2-B and anatase whiskers, respectively. The synthesized LTO whiskers from TiO2-B whiskers via a solid state reaction at 650 degrees C have a high degree of crystallinity with an average diameter of 300 nm. However, when anatase whiskers were used as the precursor, only particle morphology LTO was produced at 750 degrees C. The further analysis of the precursors, the intermediate products and the final products reveal that the crystal structure of the anatase hinders the diffusion of lithium, leading to a typical reaction diffusion process. Under this condition, only particle morphology LTO can be produced. However, the crystal structure of the TiO2-B is easy for lithium diffusion and the process is performed in two separated steps (i.e., diffusion and reaction), which makes it possible to decrease the solid-state reaction temperature down to 650 degrees C and then maintain the morphologies of whiskers.

The unique well-defined \"center-diverging microchannel\" dandelion-like structures were observed in the aerogel microspheres and a formation mechanism of the structure, i.e. radial-directional freezing-thawing, was proposed. After further thermal reduction, the reduced graphene oxide aerogel microspheres were obtained and the center-diverging microchannel structures can be remained. Due to their highly porous, hierarchical and hydrophobic structure as well as a random packing effect, the aerogel microspheres possess excellent adsorption ability for various organic solvents and oils, showing their potential applications in environmental pollutant treatment.","1782":"An asymptotic meshless method using the differential reproducing kernel (DRK) interpolation and multiple time scale methods is developed for the three-dimensional (3D) free vibration analysis of sandwich functionally graded material (FGM) circular hollow cylinders with combinations of simply-supported and clamped edge conditions. In the formulation, we perform the mathematical processes of nondimensionalization, asymptotic expansion and successive integration to obtain recurrent sets of motion equations for various order problems. Classical shell theory (CST) is derived as a first-order approximation of the 3D elasticity theory, and the motion equations for higher-order problems retain the same differential operators as those of CST, although with different nonhomogeneous terms. Expanding the primary field variables of each order as the Fourier series functions in the circumferential direction, and interpolating these in the axial direction using the DRK interpolation, we can obtain the leading-order solutions of this analysis. The higher-order modifications can be obtained in a systematic manner, in which the solvability and normality conditions are used to eliminate secular terms and uniquely determine these modifications. Some 3D solutions of the natural frequencies of sandwich FGM cylinders and their corresponding through-thickness distributions of modal variables are given to demonstrate the performance of the asymptotic DRK-based meshless method.","1115":"Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) showed natural nanotubular structures with similar chemical composition to kaolin. This paper reviewed the exciting applications of HNTs due to their abundantly deposit, nanoscale lumens, high length-to-diameter ratios, and relatively low surface hydroxyl group density. HNTs have been used as ideal templates for conveniently immobilizing nanoparticles, which could enable the construction of designed nanoarchitectures that are extremely attractive as supports for heterogeneous catalysts and for use in the fuel cells and related technologies that exploited the inherent 'smallness' and hollow characteristics of the nanoparticles. The recent developments in this area by exploring the various techniques with which HNTs could be functionalized with metal nanoparticles, and the diverse applications of the resulting materials overviewed in detail. The corresponding interfacial characteristics of the nanocomposites were emphasized. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Across five diverse river\/estuary systems we find evidence of terrestrially derived ligands with binding constants (log K-Fe(II)L) mainly in the range 6-8. These Fe(II) ligands were stable over short time periods (1-2 days), generally equivalent to, or in excess of, ambient freshwater Fe(II) concentrations (which ranged from 12 to 3600 nM) and had similar binding constants to ligands that were leached by water from vegetation and detritus (log K-Fe(II)L 7-8). A class of terrestrially derived ligands may therefore be important in stabilising Fe(II) concentrations in freshwater systems. However, in coastal seawater the impact of these ligands upon Fe(II) speciation is likely to be diminished due to a combination of dilution, loss of humic material during flocculation and increased ionic strength. The temperate and sub-tropical river systems studied included the Beaulieu (England), Itchen (England), Cape Fear (North Carolina, USA), Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) and Loch Etive (Scotland). Freshwaters in each system possessed a broad range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 200-1300 mu M), labile dissolved Fe (LDFe, Fe < 0.2 mu m available to ferrozine after reduction with ascorbic acid, 100 nM-20 mu M) and pH (5.5-8.5). In the Itchen estuary, where anthropogenic discharge constitutes >10% of freshwater input, ligand binding constants were elevated (up to log K-Fe(II)L 11) and the expected decrease in LDFe with increasing salinity along the estuary was not observed (LDFe and DOC both peaked at a salinity of 7) due to effluent inputs.

One option for safe environmental and economic disposal of these wastes is to reuse them in building materials. Many past studies have reported that the use of CRT glass and LCD glass waste as a part of fine aggregate and few others reported the possible use as a part of binder material. This paper presents an overview for the previous literature which was carried out on the use of CRT and LCD recycled glass as a partial or a complete replacement of the natural fine aggregate in traditional mortars and concretes based on Portland cement (PC). Fresh properties, hardened properties and durability of these mortars and concretes have been reviewed in this paper. This review showed that using CRT and LCD glass sand in the matrix led to some advantages and some disadvantages. The main disadvantages of using these systems are decreasing compressive strength and increasing the expansion of alkali-silica reaction (ASR). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The microstructures, phase compositions and thermal insulation performance of three coatings were analyzed in detail. The results of thermal diffusivity test by a laser flash method showed that the thermal diffusivities of YSZ, Sc2O3-YSZ and SiO2 aerogel are 0.553, 0.539 and 0.2097 x 10(-6) m(2)\/s, respectively. Then, the thermal insulation performances of three kinds of coating were investigated from 20 degrees C to 400 degrees C using high infrared radiation heat flux technology. The experimental results indicated that the corresponding temperature difference between the top TC4 alloy (400 degrees C) and the bottom surface of YSZ is 41.5 degrees C for 0.6 mm thickness coating. For I mm thickness coating, the corresponding temperature difference between the top TC4 alloys (400 degrees C) and the bottom surface of YSZ, ScYSZ, aerogel three specimens is 54, 54.6 and 208 degrees C, respectively. The coating thickness and species were found to influence the heat insulation ability. In these materials. YSZ and ScYSZ exhibited a little difference for heat insulation behavior. However. SiO2 aerogel was the best one among them and it can be taken as protection material on TC4 In outer space. SiO2 aerogel can meet the need of thermal insulation of TC4 of high-speed aircraft.

The structure was elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and the crystal belongs to the triclinic system with the space group P (1) over bar. The crystallinity of the material was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction which coincides well with the simulated pattern with varied intensities. The band gap energy is estimated by the application of the Kubelka-Munk algorithm. Theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT), to derive the optimized geometry, dipole moment, HOMO-LUMO energies and first-order molecular hyperpolarizability, beta (similar to 84 times that of urea). The energy and oscillator strengths calculated by TD-DFT results complement the experimental findings. The atomic charge distributions of the various atoms were obtained by Mulliken charge population analysis. The molecular stability and bond strength were investigated by applying natural bond orbital analysis. Investigation of the intermolecular interactions and crystal packing via Hirshfeld surface analysis, based on single-crystal XRD, reveals that the close contacts are associated with molecular interactions. Fingerprint plots of the Hirshfeld surfaces were used to locate and analyze the percentage of hydrogen-bonding interactions. The grown crystals were further characterized by FT-IR, FT-Raman and TG\/DTA.","7175":"Valorization of a profusely available alternate resource, biomass and in particular its 3-D intricate component lignin into low molecular weight aromatic products are used as platform chemicals and fuel additives, and developing a low temperature catalytic process is imperative in preserving atom efficiency. Ionic liquids, due to their unique properties, offer an advantage to develop such methods under milder conditions. Herein, we show use of -SO3H functionalized imidazolium based various recyclable Bronsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs) in catalytic quantity under ambient pressure at 120 degrees C for depolymerization of lignin (60 000 g mol(-1)) into THF soluble products with high efficiency (78% yield, 95% +\/- 5% mass balance). The decoding of this efficiency by 1D and 2D (HSQC\/NOSEY) NMR, FT-IR and RAMAN studies exemplify that the -OH group(s) interact with the electron deficient BAIL cation. The mechanistic insights unraveled in this study open a plethora of opportunities to design catalysts for developing efficient processes.","1535":"Studies on the fabrication of nanoscaled calcium aluminate materials and their growth mechanisms still present key challenges. In this work, we report the catalyst-free chemical vapor deposition of calcium aluminate nanostructures including nanoflakes and nanochains during the carbonization of woody biomass at 1500 degrees C in H-2. The mixture of Al and Al2O3 is prepared as a starting material with henequen fibers for the synthesis. Hexagonal CaAl12O19 nanoflakes and monoclinic CaAl2O4 nanochains are found as main products after the synthesis. The CaA1(12)O(19)nanoflakes have thickness of approximately 100 nm. The CaAl2O4 nanochains exhibit a regular periodic structure that is composed of nanowires and nanobeads of 100 nm and 300 nm in diameter, respectively. The nanochains oriented along the (100) plane grow to lengths of dozens of microns. The surface of nanochains is covered by an amorphous layer with a thickness of approximately 5 nm.

Novel chitosan-ZnSe\/ZnS (CS-ZnSe\/ZnS) nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step ionic gelation technique, with ZnSe\/ZnS quantum dots (ZnSe\/ZnS QDs) as cross-linking agent and for fluorescent labeling. The approach not only avoids the use of emulsifiers and chemical cross-linking agents but also prevents the possibility of damage to drugs. The fluorescent CS-ZnSe\/ZnS nanoparticles were about 100-500 nm in size and stable in a physiological environment. Low cytotoxicity was ensured by investigation with mouse lung carcinoma cells. The cell viability remained 99% when the concentration of CS-ZnSe\/ZnS nanoparticles increased to 200 mu g mL(-1). In the in vitro drug release experiment, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) loaded within CS-ZnSe\/ZnS nanoparticles had more preferable sustained-release performance and longer equilibrium time compared with that of the pure 5-Fu. The fluorescent CS-ZnSe\/ZnS nanoparticles are expected to be used for biological fluorescent labeling and drug carriers.","3308":"Here we report the microwave shielding properties of a light weight three dimensional (3D) sponge like graphene aerogel (GA) derived from graphene oxide (GO). GA is a new exotic form of graphene nanosheet, which shows improved shielding features as compared to its pristine counterpart. The structural and microstructural characteristics of this new indigenous 3D sponge like graphene aerogel architecture have been probed by XRD, Raman, SEMand TEM\/HRTEM. Furthermore, the porosity of this newly synthesized structure has been investigated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, which confirms the high surface area of similar to 516 m(2) g(-1) with an average pore diameter of similar to 2.5 nm. The high surface area and better porosity improve the EMI shielding effectiveness of GA. Simultaneously, the GA nanostructure also enhances the dielectric properties which provide a better alternative for EMI shielding materials as compared to GO. This engineered GA exhibits enhanced shielding effectiveness (similar to 20.0 dB at 0.20 g in a frequency region of 12.4 to 18.0 GHz) as compared to the conventional GO. Thus, the result of the EMI shielding of GA offers a new ingenious nanostructure which can be used as an EMI pollutant quencher for next-generation EMI shielding devices.","6794":"Hybrid hydrogels (W-C gels), composed of PDMAEMA, cellulose nanowhisker (CNW) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), were prepared for developing a stimuli-responsive drug-release system. Compared to the neat gels, W-C gels exhibit improved properties, which are directly dependent on the content of both the CNW and CMCS. For W-C gels, an increase in the CNW has an obvious reinforcement effect, which could be strengthened further by an increased CMCS content, due to the strong interaction between these components. Better compression resistance and elasticity is also observed as the CNW and CMCS content increases. Moreover, the W-C gels retain good swelling capacity with obvious responsiveness to both pH and temperature, which is similar to that of neat gels; the ionization of CMCS increases the swelling ratio of gels in both acidic and alkaline conditions, except in a certain pH region (pH = 4-6), corresponding to the correlative isoelectric points (IEP) of CMCS with PDMAEMA, where a low swelling ratio is found. In the meantime, the increased CNW content brings about a decreased swelling ratio and a faster deswelling rate in the gels. To test the potential of W-C gels as drug carriers, flutamide was used as a target drug to analyze the drug-loading and release properties of the gels. The hybrid gels exhibit better drug-loading ability than neat gels; for W-C gels, a burst release is followed by a slow and sustained release, and the release of the drug could be controlled by deprotonation or protonation of PDMAEMA and CMCS in the gels under different pH conditions; this is fast in alkaline conditions and slow in acidic conditions, and the drug-release mechanism with a changed pH value could be explained by the superposition of Fickian diffusion.","6023":"Nontoxic, sustainable, and cost-effective, Group IV materials are attractive for a broad range of electronic and optoelectronic applications, although the indirect principal band gaps of silicon and germanium (Ge) present complications that impact device design and cost. Previous studies have shown that the band structures of these materials can be modified by the influence of quantum confinement in nanostructures or by alloying with tin (Sn) in metastable thin films; to date, neither method has produced a material with a direct band gap of appropriate energy for application in, for example, efficient solar photovoltaics. We have developed a facile colloidal method for the synthesis of size-controlled, homogeneous SnxGe1-x alloy nanocrystals (NCs) with remarkably high tin concentration (x up to 0.42). We demonstrate that NCs of the same size exhibit a pronounced, systematic red-shift in the optical band gap, and a significant increase in molar absorptivity, with increasing Sn-content, and a measurable photoluminescence was observed from NCs with high contents. The indications of at least partial direct-gap character in these NCs, combined with their broad tunability throughout the infrared, suggest their promise for use in solution-processed solar cells.","6046":"This paper described the fabrication of a flexible composite film electrode (rGT) composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and TiO2 in an aligned stacking structure of rGO\/TiO2 layers using a simple vacuum-assisted filtration method. The SEM images of rGO and rGT films indicate that the rGO film (d = 5.6 +\/- 0.5 mm) was highly expanded into a layered structure of rGT (d = 7.2 +\/- 0.5 mm) intercalated by the TiO2 nanoparticles, which prevent the interlayer stacking of graphene sheets. The intensities of C-O and C=O bonding peaks in X-ray photoelectron spectra of rGT films decreased dramatically, as the reduction temperature was increased from 100 to 600 degrees C, indicating almost complete removal of the oxygenated functional groups. Hence, the electrochemical properties of rGT film electrodes significantly relied on the reduction temperature of graphene oxide (GO)-TiO2 film. The rGT(600) electrode (annealed at 600 degrees C) in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibited the specific capacitance of 286 F g(-1) in addition to the excellent cycling stability with 93% capacitance retention after 1000 continuous charge\/discharge cycles at 1 A g(-1). The specific capacitance of the rGT600 electrode in the expanded interlayer stacking structure of rGO and TiO2 particles was by 63% higher than that of the three-dimensional TiO2-graphene hydrogel electrode (175 F g(-1), 1 A g(-1)) prepared using a one-step hydrothermal approach. The modification in the preparation of the composite films comprising rGO sheets and TiO2 particles optimized the supercapacitor electrodes into the expanded interlayer stacking rGO\/TiO2 structure, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance, which is required for the development of advanced micro-size and flexible electrodes in energy storage devices.","7059":"New D-A-D type difluoroboron beta-diketonate complexes with terminal triphenylamines ABA, ABVA and AVBVA were synthesized. It was found that stable organogels could be gained from ABVA and AVBVA without traditional gelation groups in mixed solvents containing 1,4-dioxane, and balanced pi-pi interactions were the driving forces for the gel formation. Interestingly, the organogels based on ABVA and AVBVA exhibited emission close to the NIR (near infrared) region. To the best of our knowledge, such narrow band gap low molecular-weight p-gelators have not been reported. In particular, xerogel-based films generated from ABVA and AVBVA could be used as sensors to detect gaseous aliphatic primary amines with high performance. For example, after exposing to saturated n-butylamine and n-propylamine vapors for 30 s, the emission of the films was quenched completely and new strong emission at ca. 560 nm appeared on account of the decomposition of the difluoroboron b beta-diketonate complexes.","2124":"A new kind of soft carbon and hard carbon composite nanofibers were fabricated from isotropic pitch and polyacrylonitrile via simple electrospinning followed by stabilization and carbonization.

The composite nanofibers electrodes display a large reversible capacity of 452 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 20 mA g(-1) and a capacity of 255 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique fibrous structure which will facilitate electrons and ions transfer and the porous structure which will accommodate quantities of lithium ions.

Atomic layers of TiO2 were further deposited on the electrode and the thickness was controlled by adjusting the number of deposition cycles to 0, 5, 20 and 40. The results showed that all the surface modified electrodes demonstrate high capacity, good rate capability, and enhanced cyclability compared to the bare electrode. Specifically, the electrode contained 59% (by weight, wt%) sulfur and with the addition of 20 cycle-TiO2 it demonstrated a superior boost in the active sulfur utilization (discharge capacity: 1374 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C). It also delivered initial discharge capacity up to 1069.5 mA h g(-1) and 918.3 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C with an average coulombic efficiency of about 99.7%. Moreover, the capacity retention increased from 42% to 61% from 0.1C to 4C with the addition of 20 cycle-TiO2. The improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the on-site TiO2 absorption for polysulfide retention as well as the charge transfer enhancement. Theoretical calculations revealed that TiO2 exhibits a strong binding energy for lithium polysulfide species. These results suggest that the TiO2 modified NG has potential to be used as a cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries.","0":"This study assesses the suitability and sensitivity of select acoustic devices (Arborsonic Decay Detector, Fakopp Ultrasonic Timer with two types of sensors-TD45 and US10, and Fakopp 2D) for identification of damage in seven approximately 315 year old fir joining beams acquired during the reconstruction of the Baroque truss in the St. Mary of the Assumption Church in Vranov nad Dyji, Czech Republic. The particular acoustic devices did not always provide similar results. However, brown rot and other inner damages in fir beams, located closer to their endings situated on masonry and connected with rafters, were determined with all acoustic devices. The possibility of indirect prediction of the strength, elasticity and hardness of the historical wood by means of the acoustic method was verified by correlation analyses, however, not seldom without higher significance. Generally, the results obtained indicate that it is not possible to fully rely on in situ acoustic methods for inspection of defects in wooden elements of historical structures, and therefore they should be combined with visual inspection and some other instrumental method(s).

To address this issue, we designed a thin cathode inactive material interlayer modified separator to block polysulfides. There are two advantages for this strategy. First, the coating material totally comes from the cathode, thus avoids the additional weights involved. Second, the cathode inactive material modified separator improve the reversible capacity and cycle performance by combining gelatin to chemically bond polysulfides and the carbon layer to physically block polysulfides. The research results confirm that with the cathode inactive material modified separator, the batteries retain a reversible capacity of 644 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles, showing a low capacity decay of about 0.11% per circle at the rate of 0.5C.","2423":"The antitumor effect of chemotherapeutics loaded micelles mainly depends on two aspects: the accumulation in the tumor region and the penetration into the tumor interior. These two processes have different demands on particle size. The optimal particle size for enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) is commonly believed to be around 100 rim, while much smaller size is desired for deeper penetration into the tumor interior. To address these two different requirements, we constructed size shifting micelle nanoclusters (MNC) based on a cross-linked framework interspersed with micelles. The particle size of the micelles was 14.6 +\/- 0.8 rim and increased to 104.2 +\/- 8.1 nm after the MNC were formed, leading to an effective utilization of the EPR effect. MNC were shifted to independent micelles in lysosomes, so that a more favorable particle size for penetration could be realized. The results of antitumor growth in vivo demonstrated that size-shifting MNC were more beneficial for tumor therapy than micelles.","838":"Thermal electrical noise in living cells is considered to be the minimum threshold for several biological response mechanisms that pertain to electric fields. Existing models that purport to explain and interpret this phenomena yield perplexing results. The simplest model, in which the biomembrane is considered to be a linear dielectric, yields an equilibrium noise level that is several orders of magnitude larger than what is observed experimentally. An alternative approach of estimating the thermal noise as the Nyquist noise of a resistor within a finite frequency bandwidth, yields little physical insight. In this work, we argue that the nonlinear dielectric behavior must be accounted for. Using a statistical mechanics approach, we analyze the thermal fluctuations of a fully coupled electromechanical biomembrane. We develop a variational approximation to analytically obtain the benchmark results for model fluid membranes as well as physically reasonable estimates of the minimum electrical field threshold that can be detected by cells. Qualitatively, at least, our model is capable of predicting all known experimental results. The predictions of our model also suggest that further experimental work is warranted to clarify the inconsistencies in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The natural rubber was cross-linked using the electron beam irradiation. The irradiation doses were of 75, 150, 300 and 600 kGy and the concentrations of wood sawdust were of 10 and 20 phr, respectively. As a result of wood sawdust adding, the physical and mechanical properties such as hardness, modulus at 100% elongation and tensile strength, showed significant improvements. The presence of wood sawdust fibers has a reinforcing effect on natural rubber, similar or better than of mineral fillers. An increase in the irradiation dose leads to the increasing of cross-link density, which is reflected in the improvement of hardness, modulus at 100% elongation and tensile strength of blends. The cross-linking rates, appreciated using the Flory-Rehner equation, have increased with the amount of wood sawdust in blends and with the irradiation dose. Even if the gel fraction values have varied irregularly with the amount of wood sawdust and irradiation dose it was over 90% for all blends, except for the samples without wood sawdust irradiated with 75 kGy. The water uptake increased with increasing of fiber content and decreased with the irradiation dose.","3433":"One of the least known compounds among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is the layered triclinic technetium dichalcogenides (TcX2, X = S, Se). In this work, we systematically study the structural, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers based on density functional theory (DFT). We find that TcS2 and TcSe2 can be easily exfoliated in a monolayer form because their formation and cleavage energy are analogous to those of other experimentally realized TMDCs monolayer. By using a hybrid DFT functional, the TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers are calculated to be indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 1.91 and 1.69 eV, respectively. However, bilayer TcS2 exhibits direct-bandgap character, and both TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers can be tuned from semiconductor to metal under effective tensile\/compressive strains. Calculations of visible light absorption indicate that 2D TcS2 and TcSe2 generally possess better capability of harvesting sunlight compared to single-layer MoS2 and ReSe2, implying their potential as excellent light-absorbers. Most interestingly, we have discovered that the TcSe2 monolayer is an excellent photocatalyst for splitting water into hydrogen due to the perfect fit of band edge positions with respect to the water reduction and oxidation potentials. Our predictions expand the two-dimensional (2D) family of TMDCs, and the remarkable electronic\/optical properties,of monolayer TcS2 and TcSe2 will place them among the most promising 2D TMDCs for renewable energy application in the future.","1940":"Helical carbon nanofiber (HCNF) is prepared by the pyrolysis of acetylene using Cu nanoparticle catalyst and investigated as the low-cost counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. The obtained HCNF sample displays a form of regular single nanocoil with the coil diameter of 50 nm and has a high surface area of 156 m(2) g(-1). The electrochemical measurements indicate that HCNF electrode possesses an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I-3(-); the charge-transfer resistance of HCNF electrode is 1.1 Omega cm(2) in the I-\/I-3(-) redox electrolyte. Under illumination of 100 mW cm(-2) (AM 1.5), the dye-sensitized solar cell based on HCNF counter electrode achieves an energy conversion efficiency of 6.74%, which is comparable to that of the device based on Pt counter electrode.

At 1.0 wt% monomer concentration and 30 degrees C as the polymerization temperature, polymers of different morphologies were obtained depending on the ways of agitation. Under mechanical stirring, a rope-form polymer was obtained at low stirring rate and an aggregate of granular polymers was observed with a stirring rate of 600 r per min or higher; whereas polymer nanofibers were observed with quiescent polymerization and reciprocating shaking. Under quiescent polymerization with a monomer concentration of 1.0 wt%, the influence of the polymerization temperature on the morphology of the polymer was studied. It was found that spherical particles were formed at 0 degrees C, whereas fibrous polyurea was observed at 30 degrees C or higher. Studies on the influence of the monomer concentration at 30 degrees C revealed that nanofibers were obtained at 2.0 wt% of monomer concentration or lower; and spherical particles were formed with higher monomer concentration. The basic properties of the polymers were characterized. This paper provides a novel and facile pathway to the fabrication of a novel type nanofiber of polyurea based on toluene diisocyanate and 4,4'-oxydianiline.","8":"The peptide HsTX1[R14A] is a potent and selective blocker of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3, a well-recognized therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. To overcome the poor oral absorption and consequent need for regular injections, the potential of the buccal mucosa for systemic delivery of HsTX1 [R14A] was investigated. For in vitro studies, FITC-HsTX1[R14A] and HsTX1[R14A], in solution or formulated in a mucoadhesive chitosan-based gel (3%, w\/v) with or without cetrimide (5%, w\/w), were applied to porcine buccal epithelium mounted between Ussing chambers and buccal mucosal permeation assessed. HsTX1[R14A] was also administered to Swiss outbred mice at a dose of 10 mg\/kg in the same formulations. In vitro, administration of FITC-HsTX1[R14A] and HsTX1[R14A] in the chitosan gel containing cetrimide resulted in detectable buccal permeation with 0.75% and 0.58%, respectively, of the applied dose appearing in the receptor chamber over 5 h. After buccal administration to mice, HsTX1 [R14A] was detected in plasma, with the presence of cetrimide in the gel further enhancing plasma exposure, with area under the plasma concentration-time curve values of 77.9 +\/- 9.7 and 31.0 +\/- 2.3 nM.h, respectively. The buccal mucosa is a promising alternative administration route for the systemic delivery of HsTX1[R14A] for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The current study prepared a coprecipitate (CP), a freeze-dried (FD) preparation, a ground mixture (GM), and a physical mixture (PM) of CA and gamma-CD, and this study then assessed the physicochemical properties and antioxidant capacity of these preparations. PXRD patterns revealed that a PM and a GM prepared at a certain molar ratio (CA\/gamma-CD = 1\/1) produced a diffraction peak due to CA crystals. Diffractions peaks characteristic of CA and gamma-CD disappeared with the CP, but new peaks were noted. In addition, an FD with CA and gamma-CD at a molar ratio of 1\/1 produced a halo pattern. DSC measurements revealed that the PM produced an endothermic peak at 220 A degrees C due to the melting of CA, but the endothermic peak due to CA disappeared with the CP, FD, and GM. IR spectra revealed that the absorption peak due to the carbonyl group (C=O) of CA shifted for both the CP and the FD. The absorption peak due to C=C in the aromatic ring of CA also shifted. These findings presumably indicate molecular interaction between CA and gamma-CD when the 2 substances are present at a molar ratio of 1\/1 (CA\/gamma-CD). In the GM, molecular interaction presumably occurred as a result of heat. The preparations were compared to CA alone in dissolution testing, which revealed that the CP and FD both had a high rate of dissolution. H-1-H-1 NMR (NOESY) spectra revealed cross peaks involving protons of the gamma-CD cavity and protons of the aromatic ring of CA. Thus, the formation of CA and gamma-CD inclusion complexes helped to improve the dissolution of CA and gamma-CD at a molar ratio of 1\/1. The CP and FD had a higher antioxidant capacity than did CA alone. This presumably indicates that the formation of CA and gamma-CD inclusion complexes helped to increase the electron density of CA in the CD cavity.","1039":"One scenario of interest for the long-term safety assessment of a spent nuclear fuel repository involves the loss of bentonite barrier material through contact with dilute groundwater at a transmissive fracture interface. Small-scale, flow-through, artificial fracture experiments demonstrated that the quasi-free swelling of compacted montmorillonite into thin, horizontal fractures in the presence of dilute aqueous solutions leads to the formation of an inner, rigid gel-like phase and an outer, sol phase, with a distinct interface separating these two phases. The mechanical strength of the solid phase at this interface was assessed through a set of rheological measurements performed at various salt and montmorillonite solids concentrations. \"Sol\/gel\" phase transformations were identified in suspensions containing between 2 and 4 vol.% solids content with electrolyte concentrations below 17 mM NaCl. At 4 vol.% solids content all of the examined suspensions displayed gel-like properties. The results and analysis further revealed that it can be considered highly unlikely that mechanical forces due to groundwater flow in natural rock fractures would be sufficiently strong to remove any clay material at the solid\/solution interface.

Manganese oxides are synthesized via the reaction of NaMnO4 and fumaric acid to form monolithic gels of disordered, mixed-talent Na-MnOx; incorporated Na+ is readily exchanged for H+ by subsequent acid rinsing to form a more crystalline H-MnOx phase. For both Na-MnOx and H-MnOx forms, controlled pore-fluid removal yields either densified, yet still mesoporous, xerogels or low-density aerogels (prepared by drying from supercritical CO2). The performance of these MnOx nanoarchitectures as filtration media is assessed using dynamic-challenge microbreakthrough protocols. We observe technologically relevant sorption capacities under both dry conditions and wet (80% relative humidity) for each of the three toxic industrial chemicals investigated. The Na-MnOx xerogels and aerogels provide optimal performance with the aerogel exhibiting maximum sorption capacities of 39, 200, and 680 mg g(-1) for NH3, SO2, and H2S, respectively. Postbreakthrough characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirms that NH3 is captured and partially protonated within the MnOx structure, while SO2 undergoes oxidation by the redox-active oxide to form adsorbed sulfate at the MnOx surface. Hydrogen sulfide is also oxidized to form a combination of sulfate and sulfur\/polysulfide products, concomitant with a decrease in the average Mn oxidation state from 3.43 to 2.94 and generation of a MnOOH phase.","3172":"Premature drug release is a common drawback in stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems (DDS), especially if it depends on internal triggers, which are hard to control, or a single external stimulus, which can only have one function. Thus, many DDS systems have been reported that combined different triggers;, however, limited success has been established in fine-tuning the release process, mainly due to the poor bioavailability and complexity of the reported designs. This paper reports the design of a hybrid microcapsule (h-MC) by a simple layer-by-layer technique comprising polysaccharides (sodium alginate, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid), iron oxide, and graphene oxide (GO). Electrostatic assembly of the oppositely charged polysaccharides and graphene sheets provided a robust structure in which to load drugs through pH control. The polysaccharide component ensured high biocompatibility, bioavailability, and tumor cells targeting. The alternative magnetic field and near infrared laser triggerable Fe3O4@GO component provided for dual high-energy and high-penetration hyperthermia therapy. On demand drug release from h-MC can be achieved by synchronizing these external triggers, making the release highly controllable. The synergistic effect of hyperthermia and chemotherapy was successfully confirmed in vitro and in vivo.","4594":"The non-woven wound dressing with core-shell structured fibers was prepared by coaxial electrospinning. The polycaprolactone (PCL) was electrospun as the fiber's core to provide mechanical strength whereas collagen was fabricated into the shell in order to utilize its good biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) as anti-bacterial agent were loaded in the shell whereas the vitamin A palmitate (VA) as healing-promoting drug was encapsulated in the core. Resulting from the fiber's core-shell structure, the VA released from the core and Ag-NPs present in the shell can endow the dressing both heal-promoting and anti-bacteria ability simultaneously, which can greatly enhance the dressing's clinical therapeutic effect. The dressing can maintain high swelling ratio of 190% for 3 d indicating its potential application as wet dressing. Furthermore, the dressing's anti-bacteria ability against Staphylococcus aureus was proved by in vitro anti-bacteria test. The in vitro drug release test showed the sustainable release of VA within 72 h, while the cell attachment showed L929 cells can well attach on the dressing indicating its good biocompatibility. In conclusion, the fabricated nanofibrous dressing possesses multiple functions to benefit wound healing and shows promising potential for clinical application.","3658":"Antimicrobial packaging systems are developed to increase the shelf life of foods by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. In this work, antimicrobial poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) films incorporating different amounts of chitosan nanofibers (CS-NF) have been prepared via solution casting technique. Their morphology, structure, thermal stability, crystallization and melting behaviour, water absorption, hydrophilicity, barrier, migration, antibacterial, mechanical and viscoelastic properties have been investigated. Uniform films without pores were attained, as revealed by SEM, suggesting good compatibility between the matrix and nanofiller phases. Further, IR spectra demonstrated the existence of strong H-bonding interactions between PBAT and CS-NF. The nanofibers acted as nucleating agents, raising the crystallization temperature and the degree of crystallinity of the copolyester, and also increased its thermal stability and flammability. Compared to neat PBAT, the biocomposites showed higher stiffness, strength and glass transition temperatures whilst reduced ductility, oxygen and water vapour permeability. For all the nanocomposites, the migration levels in both non-polar and polar simulants were considerably below the overall limits established by the current legislation on food contact materials. The films displayed antibacterial activity against common foodborne pathogens: Gram-positive S. aureus and B. subtilis as well as Gram negative S. enteritidis and E. coli bacteria, and the biocide effect was systematically stronger against Gram-negative cells. These sustainable and biodegradable antimicrobial films meet the growing demand for green packaging from the food and beverage industry.","339":"3-Aminoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines have been synthesized through a condensation reaction of 2-aminopyridine, an aldehyde and an alkyl or aryl isocyanide in high yields in the presence of a catalytic amount of cellulose@Fe2O3 as a magnetically recoverable heterogeneous catalyst.

La1-xSrxFeO3-delta has shown promise for use as an OSM in methane reforming reactions due to its high product selectivity, fast oxide diffusion, and cycle stability. Here, we investigate the structural evolution of the series La1-xSrxFeO3-delta for x = 0, 1\/3, 1\/2, 2\/3, and 1, using in situ synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, as it is cycled under the conditions of a chemical looping reactor (methane and oxygen atmospheres). In the compositions x = 1\/3, 1\/2, 2\/3, and 1, we discover an \"envelope\", or temperature range, of oxygen storage capacity (OSC), where oxygen can easily and reversibly be inserted and removed from the OSM. Our in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction results reveal that while samples with higher Sr contents had a higher OSC, those same samples suffered from slower reaction kinetics and some, such as the x = 1\/2 and x = 2\/3 compositions, had local variations in Sr content, which led to inhomogeneous regions with varying reaction rates. Therefore, we highlight the importance of in situ diffraction studies, and we propose that these measurements are required for the thorough evaluation of future candidate OSMs. We recommend La2\/3Sr1\/3FeO3-delta as the optimal OSM in the series because its structure remains homogeneous throughout the reaction, and its OSC \"envelope\" is similar to that of the higher doped materials.","1862":"Molecular imaging holds considerable promise for elucidating biological processes in normal physiology as well as disease states, but requires noninvasive methods for identifying analytes at sub-micromolar concentrations. Particularly useful are genetically encoded, single-protein reporters that harness the power of molecular biology to visualize specific molecular processes, but such reporters have been conspicuously lacking for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Herein, we report TEM-1 beta-lactamase (bla) as a single-protein reporter for hyperpolarized (HP) Xe-129 NMR, with significant saturation contrast at 0.1 mu m. Xenon chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) interactions with the primary allosteric site in bla give rise to a unique saturation peak at 255 ppm, well removed (approximate to 60 ppm downfield) from the Xe-129-H2O peak. Useful saturation contrast was also observed for bla expressed in bacterial cells and mammalian cells.","2458":"Binder-free composites of electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ecrGO) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated as supercapacitors electrodes operating in aqueous systems. GO was found to be electrochemically reduced according to the XRD and Raman data. Therefore, this facile and controllable method was applied to reduce GO in the GO\/MWCNTs composites, generating ecrGO\/MWCNTs composites. The ecrGO\/MWCNTs composites exhibit higher specific capacitance (C-sp) than ecrGO because the intercalation of MWCNTs into ecrGO sheets increases the surface areas, according to the TEM, XRD and N-2 adsorption-desorption results. The composites with different mass ratios of GO to MWCNTs (10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10) were investigated. The ecrGO\/MWCNTs composite (GO: MWCNTs = 5:1) showed the highest C-sp from the cyclic voltammetry results at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1), and it expressed C-sp of 165 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and 93% retention after 4000 cycles of charge\/discharge. When the mass ratio of GO to MWCNTs further decreases to 1:10, the C-sp of the composites declines, and the ecrGO\/MWCNTs composite (GO: MWCNTs = 1:10) performs a nearly pure double-layer capacitor. However, the composites containing more MWCNTs can maintain better capacitive behavior at higher rates of charge\/discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Carbons were obtained with high conversions by polycondensation of resorcinol and either 2-cyanophenol or 4-cyanophenol with formaldehyde, and subsequent carbonization at 800 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. The nitrogen content was ca. 2.4 wt%, revealing an excellent nitrogen-doping efficiency for cyanophenol derivatives when used in the form of DES. The use of either 2-cyanophenol or 4-cyanophenol modified the contribution of quaternary-N-valley groups in the resulting carbons, being larger in carbons coming from 4-cyanophenol than in those coming from 2-cyanophenol. The hierarchical porous structure was composed of micro-, meso-and macropores, and the diameter distribution of mesopores was also related to the use of either 2-cyanophenol or 4-cyanophenol. These structural and compositional differences were critical for the use of the resulting hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbons as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts. In particular, the carbons coming 4-cyanophenol proved particularly effective in the direct reduction of oxygen to OH- (H2O in acidic solution) through a four-electron (4e(-)) process with high catalytic activity and selectivity, and longer stability and stronger tolerance to crossover effects than platinum-based electrocatalysts.","1775":"Chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine units with -1,4-glycosidic linkages, is the most abundant marine biomass. Chitin monomers containing N-acetyl groups are useful precursors to various fine chemicals and medicines. However, the selective conversion of robust chitin to N-acetylated monomers currently requires a large excess of acid or a long reaction time, which limits its application. We demonstrate a fast catalytic transformation of chitin to monomers with retention of N-acetyl groups by combining mechanochemistry and homogeneous catalysis. Mechanical-force-assisted depolymerization of chitin with a catalytic amount of H2SO4 gave soluble short-chain oligomers. Subsequent hydrolysis of the ball-milled sample provided N-acetylglucosamine in 53% yield, and methanolysis afforded 1-O-methyl-N-acetylglucosamine in yields of up to 70%. Our process can greatly reduce the use of acid compared to the conventional process.","6594":"In this study, unique NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 core-shell nanotube arrays (NTAs), a promising positive electrodes for supercapacitors, have been successfully synthesized on Ni foam via a novel method.

In addition, a 3D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel has been fabricated as a negative electrode for supercapacitors, and this displays an excellent capacitance performance of 286.9 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). An asymmetric supercapacitor denoted as NiCo2S4@Ni3S2\/\/rGO has been assembled based on NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 core-shell NTAs and rGO aerogel. The NiCo2S4@Ni3S2\/\/rGO device achieves an outstanding performance with a specific capacity of 163.15 C g(-1), an energy density of 32.75 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 0.36 kW kg(-1). Moreover, it displays a remarkable cycling performance (77.5% capacity retention after 5000 cycles). These results indicate potential applications of NiCo2S4@Ni3S2\/\/rGO in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs).","622":"A magnetic nanocomposite film with the capability of reversibly collecting functionalized magnetic particles was fabricated by simultaneously imposing two orthogonal stimuli (electrical and magnetic). We demonstrate that cathodic codeposition of chitosan and Fe3O4 nano-particles while simultaneously applying a magnetic field during codeposition can (i) organize structure, (ii) confer magnetic properties, and (iii) yield magnetic films that can perform reversible collection\/assembly functions. The magnetic field triggered the self-assembly of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into hierarchical \"chains\" and \"fibers\" in the chitosan film. For controlled magnetic properties, the Fe3O4-chitosan film was electrodeposited in the presence of various strength magnetic fields and different deposition times. The magnetic properties of the resulting films should enable broad applications in complex devices. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the reversible capture and release of green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-conjugated magnetic microparticles by the magnetic chitosan film. Moreover, antibody-functionalized magnetic microparticles were applied to capture cells from a sample, and these cells were collected, analyzed, and released by the magnetic chitosan film, paving the way for applications such as reusable biosensor interfaces (e.g., for pathogen detection). To our knowledge, this is the first report to apply a magnetic field during the electrodeposition of a hydrogel to generate magnetic soft matter. Importantly, the simple, rapid, and reagentless fabrication methodologies demonstrated here are valuable features for creating a magnetic device interface.","7418":"The application of catalysis to reduced toxicity systems and benign and renewable energy systems is a central focus area for green chemistry research. It is possible to prepare heterogeneous analogues of the most commonly used homogeneous soluble catalysts by immobilizing them on various insoluble supports. The use of heterogeneous catalysts in chemical processes would simplify catalyst removal and minimize the amount of waste. Therefore, to maintain economic viability, a suitable heterogeneous system should not only minimize the production of waste, but should also exhibit activities and selectivities comparable or superior to the existing homogeneous route. Accordingly, catalysis by heteropoly (and related) compounds (HPCs) is a field of increasing importance, particularly concerning nanocatalysts. Furthermore, the heterogenization of bulk HPCs is an interesting area of research from an industrial point of view. As a rapidly growing and increasing field, HPC catalysis exhibits three main merits: (1) HPCs not only possess a strong acidic property, but also an oxidative property, which can support fast reversible multi-electron redox transformations under mild conditions. (2) HPCs exhibit fairly high thermal stability in supported or salt forms. (3) Their catalytic properties can be tuned in a wide range by changing their chemical compositions. A number of important heterogenization methods will be discussed in this review. These methods can be classified into two major categories: exchange of the HPC protons with cations (precipitation and hybridization) and immobilization of the HPCs on a suitable solid support (encapsulation, grafting, tethering and dispersion). Although these compounds have been known well for over a century, only in the last few years has scientific interest in these materials begun to increase dramatically. Therefore, in this review, we aim to describe the different methods of heterogenization of these compounds developed and reported over the past 15 years.","6611":"Blend emulsion electrospinning is widely perceived to destroy the bioactivity of proteins, and a blend emulsion of water-soluble and nonsoluble molecules is believed to be thermodynamically unstable to electrospin smoothly. Here we demonstrate a method to retain the bioactivity of disparate fragile biomolecules when electrospun. Using bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein; water-soluble vitamin C, fat soluble vitamin D3, steroid hormone hydrocortisone, peptide hormone insulin, thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), and peptide epidermal growth factor (EGF) were simultaneously blend-spun into PLGA-collagen nanofibers. Upon release, vitamin C maintained the ability to facilitate Type I collagen secretion by fibroblasts, EGF stimulated skin fibroblast proliferation, and insulin potentiated adipogenic differentiation. Transgenic cell reporter assays confirmed the bioactivity of vitamin D3, T3, and hydrocortisone. These factors concertedly increased keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation while maintaining keratinocyte basal state. This method presents an elegant solution to simultaneously deliver disparate bioactive biomolecules for wound healing applications.","6298":"Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) from biomass has become a subject of intense research activity owing to its attributes of nanosized cellulose and sustainable character. However, efficient production of nanofibrillated cellulose is still challenging with respect to the energy required for the disintegration process. In this study, a triticale crop residue was used as a source for the production of nanofibrillated cellulose, with lateral size of 20-30 nm, using a high pressure homogenizer and a conventional high speed blender. The effects of the delignification mode, fiber pretreatment and disintegration mode on the yield of NFC, the morphology of the ensuing nanofibrils and the energy consumption were investigated. The evolution of the reinforcing potential of the NFC according to the production mode was also studied. By controlling the lignin extraction mode and the carboxyl content of the fibers through TEMPO-mediated oxidation, it was possible to convert triticale pulps into nanofibrillar cellulose with an energy demand as low as 11 kW h kg(-1) using a conventional high speed blender. This approach is expected to open the way toward easier and energetically cost-effective production of nanofibrillar cellulose from crop residues.","6577":"Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital in renewable energy technologies, such as water splitting and fuel cells. Nevertheless, increasing efforts have been paid to develop non-precious metal catalysts as alternatives to noble metal catalysts for HER and ORR. However, how to rationally design and construct an advantageous catalyst is still challenging. Here, a novel cobalt-embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (Co-N-GA) catalyst is firstly rationally designed and synthesized by employing a facile strategy of implementing the confined growth of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) within graphene aerogels (GAs). It is worth noting that the Co-N-GA exhibits hierarchical porosity involving micropores, mesopores and macropores, as well as a high surface area (466.6 m(2) g(-1)). More importantly, benefiting from the synergetic effect of hierarchical porosity, high surface area, N-doped carbon and the inner Co metal, the catalyst Co-N-GA displays extraordinarily superior activity for both HER at various pH values and ORR along with better stability. Especially for HER, the onset overpotential, overpotentials@10, 100 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope on the catalyst Co-N-GA in 0.5 M H2SO4 are 0 mV, 46 mV, 183 mV and 33 mV dec(-1), respectively. Most importantly, these values are much lower than those of almost all prepared noble-metal-free HER catalysts, indicating the excellent activity for HER of our as-prepared catalyst Co-N-GA. Herein, our strategy opens a new platform to construct a variety of hierarchically porous GA-based catalysts that serve as superior electrocatalysts in energy storage and conversion technologies.","2688":"Novel multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fibers and carbide-derived carbon (CDC) MWCNT composite fibers were prepared using dielectrophoresis method. Obtained fibers were investigated as an actuator material in organic electrolytes using an isotonic and isometric electrochemical-mechanical deformation (ECMD) technique. Adding CDC particles to the fiber based electrode, physical properties (density, tensile strength, Young's modulus and conductivity) changed slightly (all changes remain in the order of 10-15%) but specific capacitance increased by 2.3 times (from 62 to 145 F g(-1)). Also the ECMD measurements (charging\/discharging in balance) reveal intriguing effects, as the CDC addition also leads to 2-3 times higher stress and strain values compared to that of neat MWCNT fiber based electrodes. These results show that the CDC-MWCNT fibers have great potential for application in actuator material or in energy storage devices like supercapacitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we illustrate this concept with the history of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which have enabled unprecedented personalization of our lifestyles through portable information and communication technology. These remarkable batteries enable the widespread use of laptop and tablet computers, access to entertainment on portable devices such as hand-held music players and video game consoles, and enhanced communication and networking on personal devices such as cellular telephones and watches. A similar transformation of transportation to electric cars and of the electricity grid to widespread deployment of variable renewable solar and wind generation, effortless time-shifting of energy generation and demand, and a transition from central to distributed energy services requires next-generation energy storage that delivers much higher performance at lower cost. The path to these next-generation batteries is likely to be as circuitous and unpredictable as the path to today's Li-ion batteries. We analyze the performance and cost improvements needed to transform transportation and the electricity grid, and we evaluate the outlook for meeting these needs with next-generation beyond Li-ion batteries.","3268":"The results of studies of micellar and self-associating polymer systems by spin probe ESR spectroscopy are summarized.

Interest in these systems is caused by prospects of their practical use as carriers in drug delivery, in biotechnology, for the enhancement of oil production, and in other purposes.","889":"Photocatalytic water splitting by solar light has received tremendous attention for the production of clean and renewable hydrogen energy from water. Some challenges still remain in improving the solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency, such as utilizing longer-wavelength photons and enhancing the photocatalytic activity and stability of H-2 production over semiconducting materials. Dye sensitization, as a successful strategy for extending the spectral responsive region (even to near-IR light) of wide bandgap semiconductors for H-2 production, was developed more than 30 years ago, but it still lacks the corresponding specialized review. This review emphasizes especially the fundamental aspects and the research advances in heterogeneous dye-sensitized semiconductor suspension systems for visible (and even near-IR) light responsive photocatalytic H-2 production, and the commonly used dyes, semiconductors, co-catalysts and electron donors are systematically discussed. Also, a short perspective on the challenges and new directions in this field is proposed, which would be of great interest in the field of solar fuel conversion.","5283":"An ultrathin sulfur layer (10 nm) wrapped polyaniline (PANI) nanofiber composite (S-PANI) with a core-shell structure was prepared via facile heterogeneous nucleation of sulfur on a water-dispersed PANI nanofiber, which displayed an initial discharge capacity of 977 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 88.3% after 100 cycles at 1 C.","3755":"Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are one of the most promising scalable electricity-storage systems to address the intermittency issues of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The prerequisite for RFBs to be economically viable and widely employed is their low cost. Here we present a new zinc-iron (Zn-Fe) RFB based on double-membrane triple-electrolyte design that is estimated to have under $100 per kW h system capital cost. Such a low cost is achieved by a combination of inexpensive redox materials (i.e., zinc and iron) and high cell performance (e.g., 676 mW cm(-2) power density). Engineering of the cell structure is found to be critical to enable the high power density. Our cost model shows that a Zn-Fe RFB demonstrates the lowest cost among some notable RFBs and could reach the 2023 cost target set by the U.S. Department of Energy ($150 per kW h).","3889":"Understanding self-assembly processes of nanoscale building blocks and characterizing their properties are both imperative for designing new hierarchical, network materials for a wide range of structural, optoelectrical, and transport applications. Although the characterization and choices of these material building blocks have been well studied, our understanding of how to precisely program a specific morphology through self-assembly still must be significantly advanced. In the recent study by Xie et al (2015 Nanotechnology 26 205602), the self-assembly of end-functionalized nanofibres is investigated using a coarse-grained molecular model and offers fundamental insight into how to control the structural morphology of nanofibrous networks. Varying nanoscale networks are observed when the molecular interaction strength is changed and the findings suggest that self-assembly through the tuning of molecular interactions is a key strategy for designing nanostructured networks with specific topologies.","196":"Efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) are a key renewable energy technology for fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water splitting, but few non-precious oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity have been discovered. Here, we propose a general strategy based on electron injection to manipulate the work function of electrocatalysts to obtain an extraordinary performance beyond precious catalysts. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the NiOOH\/Ni hybrid reveals the smallest overpotential compared to NiOOH. A novel hybrid catalyst is designed to grow Fe-doped NiOOH on graphene-encapsulated FeNi3 nanodots (FeNi3@GR@Fe-NiOOH). Accordingly, the catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity and superior durability, affording a low onset potential of 1.45 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a stable current density of 11.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V (vs. RHE) for over 12 h. The achieved turnover frequency of 1.16 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV is the best performance among the reported similar catalysts, and even better than that of the state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2). The high electrocatalytic efficiency and robust durability are essential conditions for a superior air electrode material for Zn-air batteries. Our catalyst cycled stably for 360 cycles at 1 mA cm(-2) in 20 h with no obvious attenuation over 100 cycles for 100 h.","4252":"Novel antibacterial and biocompatible transparent films based on chitosan or pullulan and two bioactive ionic liquids (ILs), cholinium hexanoate and cholinium citrate, were prepared. These ILs were selected based on their MIC values against several microbial strains, film-forming ability when blended with the polysaccharides and biocompatibility against designated human cell lines. The films were obtained through simple casting of polysaccharide aqueous solutions containing different amounts of the ILs (20 and 40 wt% with respect to the amount of polysaccharide). The physical properties of the films were investigated using transmittance measurements, thermal analysis, mechanical testing and antibacterial assays. In general, the addition of both ILs does not affect the optical transparency (up to 80% transmittance within 400-700 nm) of the films but decreased their stiffness (acting as plasticizers) and thermal stability. All chitosan-based films showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae but for pullulan only those with cholinium citrate were bioactive.","4987":"10 mol% Sc2O3-doped ZrO2 (10ScSZ) nanofibers were prepared through electrospinning followed by calcination. The phase structures and electrical conductivities of the nanofibers have been investigated as a function of the crystallite size. The cubic (c) phase can be stabilized in 10ScSZ nanofibers when the average crystallite size is smaller than 26 nm. The generated phase stability endows the nanofibers with an enhanced conductivity which increases with the decrease of crystallite size. As the average crystallite size decreased from 37 nm to 7 nm, the conductivity of the nanofibers increased by more than 20 times. An exceptionally high oxide ion conductivity of 0.023 S cm(-1) for the nanofibers was observed at 500 degrees C, which is more than 900 times higher than that of bulk 10ScSZ.","2689":"To fulfill the requirement of energy sustainability, organic solar cells (OSCs) should combine the use of solar energy as a renewable energy source with materials that guarantee a clean energy solution based on an evaluation of the full lifecycle from cradle to grave. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using combustion-produced nanoparticles (CPNs) in blends with regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), as active layer in OSCs. We present a detailed characterization of the CPNs using Raman spectroscopy, light absorption, cyclic voltammetry and differential mobility analysis, showing their optimal features of band gap and size for use as electron acceptor materials. Moreover we present a spectroscopic investigation of the P3HT: CNPs blends, using static and dynamic fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. P3HT exhibits strong quenching and shortened fluorescence lifetimes when mixed with CNPs. Interestingly, an efficient charge transfer was observed when a high loading of CNPs was added to the blend.

In this way, Ni cermet anode conductivity is not influenced, and cell cracking due to the thermal-mechanical stress from the mismatched thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) between the catalyst and anode materials, the temperature gradients within the anode caused by the highly endothermic reforming reaction of methane, and the large internal strain during the reduction process is also avoided. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), which is co-pressed with an Al2O3 substrate into a double-layered slice with a mesoporous structure, functions as an independent catalyst layer of the Ni-based anode. Under SOFC operating conditions, a K2NiF4-type oxide (Sr, La) FeO4 with homogeneously dispersed CoFe alloy nanoparticles is formed, which shows good catalytic activity for methane partial oxidation with 88% conversion at 950 degrees C in a mixture of CH4 and O-2 (1 : 1). A conventional cell with the state-of-art Ni cermet anode (NiO-8% Y stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ)\/ YSZ\/ La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ) is constructed and the electrochemical performance of cells with and without the independent catalyst layer is tested. In wet methane, the voltage of the conventional cell without the catalyst layer declines rapidly from 0.7 V to 0.1 V within 20 min at 333 mA cm(-2) and 800 degrees C. In contrast, the voltage of the modified cell with an independent catalyst layer stabilizes at 0.79 V with negligible degradation within 116 h. In wet coal bed methane (CBM), the voltage of the modified cell with an independent catalyst layer exhibits a slow decrease from 0.69 V to 0.66 V within 12 h. The stable power output of the cell with an independent catalyst layer under a constant current load in methane indicates excellent coking resistance. The microstructure and surface composition of the catalyst layer and anode are further analyzed by SEM and EDX after the stability test.","4357":"Several methods of taste evaluation, such as sensory tests and the use of electronic tongues and a taste-sensing system based on lipid\/polymer membranes, have been developed and utilized in the food and pharmaceutical fields. In particular, the tastesensing system can individually quantify five basic tastes using each type of sensor membrane. However, it is difficult to develop a sweetness sensor, because sweeteners cover a large number of compounds with diverse chemical structures and sizes. Using membrane potential measurements, the taste-sensing system needs three types of sensor membrane for each electric charge type (neutral, negative and positive) of sweetener. The sweetness sensor for uncharged sweeteners has been commercialized, but the mechanism of the response to sugars has not been clarified. Therefore, we investigated how the sensor responds to sugars in this study. As a result, we confirmed the unnecessity of the aromatic ring and that of the carboxyl group and the basic sensorrinsing solution including cations, and concluded that both the hydrophobicity and electric charge of the surface of the sensor membrane influence the sweetness response.","432":"In the present study pectin, a natural polysaccharide was employed for the one pot aqueous synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Pectin acted at the same time as both a reducing and stabilizing agent. The formation of pectin reduced GNPs (Pec-GNPs) was confirmed by using a UV-visible spectrophotometer, with a characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 527 nm. EDS analysis proved the presence of gold in the sample. The spherical morphology and crystalline nature of the Pec-GNPs was demonstrated by TEM analysis. The FTIR spectrum revealed the capping of pectin on the surface of the synthesised GNPs. Furthermore, the Pec-GNPs are found to be stable at different pH and electrolytic conditions. In vivo safety of the Pec-GNPs was established through zebra fish toxicity studies. The cationic drug doxorubicin was successfully loaded onto the synthesized anionic Pec-GNPs by an ionic complexation interaction. In vitro release studies confirmed the pH dependent sustained release of the doxorubicin. Doxorubicin loaded Pec-GNPs exhibited enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells compared to free doxorubicin, demonstrating that Pec-GNPs are efficient vehicles for the delivery of doxorubicin. Furthermore, chitosan coupled with folic acid (FA) was decorated with Pec-GNPs-DOX as a nanocarrier to improve the targeting and enhance the drug delivery to target cancer tissues by folic acid receptormediated endocytosis. It was concluded that the FA@Pec-GNPs-DOX were biocompatible and suitable for anti-cancer drug delivery, and were potentially promising as a new therapeutic system for cancer treatment.","3487":"Commercially available multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been functionalized with poly (diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA), a nitrogen containing polyelectrolyte by a simple on-off ultrasonication method. The results obtained from Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirm the functionalization of MWCNTs with PDDA. An up- shift in the positions of C1s XPS peak and a down-shift in the positions of the N1s XPS peak, has been observed along with an up-shift in the G-peak position in the Raman spectra, which suggest the occurrence of inter-molecular charge transfer from carbon atoms in MWCNTs to N+ centres in PDDA. The preliminary linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results show good electrocatalytic activity of MWCNTs functionalized with nitrogen containing polyelectrolyte, which is comparable to the results with platinum based electrodes. Thus, MWCNTs non-covalently functionalized with a nitrogen containing polyelectrolyte (PDDA) by a simple on-off ultrasonication method could be advantageous for developing efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Solubility in water is essential for developing sensors for different bio-molecules and polythiophene derivatives are excellent candidates due to their important optoelectronic properties. A pristine polythiophene chain is hydrophobic and it exhibits aqueous solubility after attachment\/grafting of ionic pendent groups or hydrophilic polymer chains on its backbone. A concise account of the different synthetic procedures of preparing water soluble polythiophene is described and all the specific techniques relevant to the synthesis of water soluble polythiophene using cationic, anionic pendent groups and grafting of hydrophilic polymers are discussed. Different grafting processes e.g. \"grafting from\" and \"grafting to\" techniques using click chemistry and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) are described in detail.

The reports on fluorescence based specific sensing of metal ions, and nitro-aromatics using water soluble polythiophenes are also embodied with an up-to-date description of the optoelectronic device applications such as logic gates, molecular thermometers, photovoltaic cells etc. Finally, a summary and outlook is presented discussing the future scope of research on this important subject.","1108":"Anion exchange membranes were fabricated from diamine-crosslinked poly(phenylene oxide) polyelectrolyte nanofibers that were functionalized with either benzyl trimethylammonium or 1,2-dimethylimidazolium groups and embedded in a reinforcing matrix of polyphenylsulfone (PPSU). Nanofibers of the polyelectrolyte precursor, brominated poly(phenylene oxide) with 0.95 CH2Br groups per mer, and PPSU were simultaneously electrospun onto a common collector and the resulting dual fiber mat was converted into a dense and defect-free anion exchange membrane by sequential soaking in a diamine crosslinker solution, exposure to chloroform vapor, and immersion in a solution of either trimethylamine or 1,2-dimethylimidazole. The degree of crosslinking and the ratio of uncharged PPSU to functionalized poly(phenylene oxide) polyelectrolyte were varied to yield composite membranes with an effective ion exchange capacity (IEC) ranging from 1.2-2.8 mmol g(-1). A membrane with benzyl trimethylammonium-functionalized polyelectrolyte fibers (4.0 mmol g(-1) IEC) with 15% crosslinks and 50 wt% uncharged PPSU exhibited a high hydroxide ion conductivity in water at 23 degrees C (66 mS cm(-1)), reasonable water swelling (96%), robust mechanical properties (15 MPa stress-at-break in the hydrated state), and good chemical stability in 1.0 M KOH at 60 degrees C.

A new microfluidic architecture is introduced - a set of traps designed to localize the droplets with respect to each other and with respect to the recording electrodes. The system allows for automated execution of experimental protocols by active control of the flow on chip with the use of simple external valves. Formation of stable artificial lipid bilayers, incorporation of alpha-hemolysin into the bilayers and electrical measurements of ionic transport through the protein pore are demonstrated.","1919":"This study describes, the synthesis of cobalt oxide nanostructures using ascorbic acid as a growth directing agent by the hydrothermal method. Ascorbic acid is used for the first time for the synthesis of cobalt oxide nanostructures and a unique morphology is prepared in the present study. The cobalt oxide nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microcopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. These analytical techniques demonstrated well defined morphology, good crystalline quality, and high purity of as prepared cobalt oxide nanostructures. The glassy carbon electrode was modified with cobalt oxide nanostructures for the development of a sensitive and selective electrochemical hydrazine sensor. The developed hydrazine sensor exhibits a linear range of 2-24 mu M. The sensitivity and limit of detection of presented hydrazine sensors are 12,734 mu A\/mM\/cm(2) and 0.1 mu M respectively. The developed hydrazine sensor is highly selective, stable, and reproducible. The proposed sensor is successfully applied for the detection of hydrazine from different water samples. The present study provides the development of an alternative tool for the reliable monitoring of hydrazine from environmental and biological samples.","1934":"A water-glass-based silica aerogel was synthesized through an ambient pressure drying method and its structural parameters, hydrophobic property, and blending with a nanofibrous polyester material were investigated. The hybrid aerogel-fibrous materials were prepared using an electrospinning method and their hydrophobic and water vapor\/air permeation characteristics were analyzed using the SPSS software by one-way ANOVA, Duncan, and 1-sample K-S tests. The BET and BJH analyses showed that the nanosilica aerogel has a pore size of 24 nm and a total pore volume of 3.5 m(3)\/g resulted in 88.6% porosity and 0.2 g\/m(3) density. The silica aerogel granules showed a high water sliding angle, whereas, the aerogel powder-coated water droplets (marbles) showed a sliding angle of as low as 5 degrees. The SEM and AFM analyses indicated the successful embedding of the aerogel powder into the nanofibrous material with an irregular beads like structure. The most aerogel content of 4 wt% in the hybrid fibrous material showed a lower mean diameter (176.2 nm) as well as a lower mean size of spaces formed between the super-fine fibers (3598.5 nm) in comparison with the fibrous material with no aerogel content. The beaded fibrous structures of the hybrid fibrous materials led to a suitable two-scale surface roughness with an improved water contact angle up to 130.1 degrees in comparison with 103.4 degrees for the one with no aerogel content. The samples surface energy was remained unchanged with 3 M water repellency of 1. Also, there was no significant difference between the water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples according to the ANOVA tests with P-values of more than 0.05. The super-fine fibers containing 2 and 4% aerogel have a higher permeability to air in comparison to the pure super-fine fibers and the super-fine fibers containing 0.5 and 1% aerogel, which may be due to the recognized effect on the reduction of the fibers diameter as well as smaller empty spaces formed between the super-fine fibers.

The modified polymers were characterised by UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The three paint systems were moderately stable under aqueous conditions, with a limited amount of leaching of the dyes from the paint polymer into the surrounding aqueous solution. Exposure of the three paint systems to a 28 W white light source induced the lethal photosensitisation of both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, both the three-dye and two-dye systems resulted in a 4 log kill against S. aureus under dark conditions, and a 1.5 log dark kill was obtained by the safranin O and 2 nm gold nanoparticle system.","1373":"Despite the great achievements that nanomedicines have obtained so far, deep penetration of nanomedicines into tumors is still a major challenge in tumor treatment. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was the main theoretical foundation for using nanomedicines to treat solid tumor. However, the antitumor efficiency is modest because the tumor is heterogeneous, with dense collagen matrix, abnormal tumor vasculature, and lymphatic system. Nanomedicines could only passively accumulate near leaky site of tumor vessels, and they cannot reach the deep region of tumor. To enhance further the tumor penetration efficiency, we developed a novel strategy of coadministering cell-homing penetration peptide iRGD with size-shrinkable and tumor-microenvironment-responsive multistage system (DOX-AuNPs-GNPs) to overcome these barriers. First, iRGD could specifically increase the permeability of tumor vascular and tumor tissue, leading to more DOX-AuNPs-GNPs leaking out from tumor vasculature. Second, the multistage system passively accumulated in tumor tissue and shrank from 131.1 to 46.6 nm to reach the deep region of tumor. In vitro, coadministering iRGD with DOX-AuNPs-GNPs showed higher cellular uptake and apoptosis ratio. In vivo, coadministering iRGD with DOX-AuNPs-GNPs presented higher penetration and accumulation in tumor than giving DOX-AuNPs-GNPs alone, leading to the best antitumor efficiency in 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model.","1195":"Polysaccharides are promising candidates for manufacturing biocompatible core-shell nanoparticles with potential in vivo use. Superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) have prospective application in both diagnosis and therapy, and so developing a novel polysaccharide shell on MNP core is of great challenge. MNPs were prepared by co-precipitation, then the surface of purified MNPs was coated with chondroitin-sulfate-A (CSA) to obtain core-shell structured magnetite nanoparticles (CSA@MNP). The effect of the added amount of CSA on the surface charging and the aggregation state of MNPs at various pHs and 10 mM NaCl was measured by electrophoresis and dynamic light scattering. The amphoteric behavior of MNPs was fundamentally modified by adsorption of CSA polyanions. A very low CSA-loading induces the aggregation of MNPs, while four times more stabilizes the dispersions over the whole pH-range studied. The coagulation kinetics experiments measured at pH=6.3 +\/- 0.3 showed that salt tolerance of CSA@MNPs rises up to similar to 150 mM NaCl. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), electrospun 1D alpha-Zn2V2O7 nanofibers exhibit a reversible capacity of similar to 708 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g(-1). A good rate capability is also achieved even at higher current densities. When cycled at a current density of 2000 mA g(-1), the electrode can still show a reversible capacity of similar to 311 mAh g(-1). The excellent cycle performance and rate capability may be due to the 1D nanofiber architectures, mesoporous structures, and relatively large specific surface area, which can provide a short ion diffusion path and continuous electron transportation. Therefore, this work presents a simple and efficient approach for fabrication of 1D alpha-Zn2V2O7 nanofibers, which are promising high-performance anode materials for LIBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most CPPs contain an abundance of cationic charged residues, typically arginine, where the amino acid compositions, rather than specific sequences, tend to determine their ability to enter cells. Hydrophobic residues are often added to cationic sequences to create efficient CPPs, but typically at the penalty of increased cytotoxicity. Here, we examined polypeptides containing glycosylated, cationic derivatives of methionine, where we found these hydrophilic polypeptides to be surprisingly effective as CPPs and to also possess low cytotoxicity. X-ray analysis of how these new polypeptides interact with lipid membranes revealed that the incorporation of sterically demanding hydrophilic cationic groups in polypeptides is an unprecedented new concept for design of potent CPPs.","2301":"Polyvinyl alcohol and phosphorylated functionalized derivatives are widely used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The present work aims to characterize chemically and biologically two types of samples based on phosphorylated polyvinyl alcohol. Synthesis and biocompatibility assays for a porous polymer scaffold based on PPVA reticulated by glutaraldehyde and foamed by CaCO3 in different ratios are shown above. Swelling index for the PPVA hydrogel goes up with the decrease in reticulation agent that has been used (glutaraldehyde) for foam production. A minimal recorded pH shift had no influence for the further development of in vitro cell assays. Moreover, samples immersed into SBF for 48h maintained their mechanical stability. Contact inhibition assay and imaging performed for 72 hours demonstrated a good cell proliferation in contact with the material sponge-like samples. Osteoblast-like cells recorded important viability in contact with both type of foam samples.

Although all the prepared CoFe2O4 nanoribbons presented an excellent ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature, their M (s) progressively increased with increasing annealing temperature but H (c) followed an opposite variation tendency. The maximum M (s) of about 80.3 emu g(-1) of the nanoribbons annealed at 750 A degrees C was basically equal to the bulk value, and the maximum H (c) of about 1802 Oe of the nanoribbons annealed at 450 A degrees C, is larger than most of reported H (c) values of other one-dimensional CoFe2O4 nanostructures by far. It suggested that the magnetization reverse processes of the CoFe2O4 nanoribbons annealed at 450 and 550 A degrees C were dominated by the coherent rotation model, while that of the CoFe2O4 nanoribbons annealed at 650 and 750 A degrees C were dominated by the growth of a reverse magnetic domain.","7197":"Despite major advances in the pathophysiological understanding of peripheral nerve damage, the treatment of nerve injuries still remains an unmet medical need. Nerve guidance conduits present a promising treatment option by providing a growth-permissive environment that 1) promotes neuronal cell survival and axon growth and 2) directs axonal extension. To this end, we designed an electrospun nerve guidance conduit using a blend of polyurea and poly-caprolactone with both biochemical and topographical cues. Biochemical cues were integrated into the conduit by functionalizing the polyurea with RGD to improve cell attachment. Topographical cues that resemble natural nerve tissue were incorporated by introducing intraluminal microchannels aligned with nanofibers. We determined that electrospinning the polymer solution across a two electrode system with dissolvable sucrose fibers produced a polymer conduit with the appropriate biomimetic properties. Human neural stem cells were cultured on the conduit to evaluate its ability to promote neuronal growth and axonal extension. The nerve guidance conduit was shown to enhance cell survival, migration, and guide neurite extension.","6598":"The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on parenchymal liver cells specifically binds multivalent carbohydrates from desialylated glycoproteins. This feature offers a huge potential for hepatocyte specific drug targeting. In this study, multiantennary N-glycans from asialofetuin have been isolated to actively target the asialoglycoprotein receptor on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.","2107":"Highly efficient solar cells with sustainable performance under severe mechanical deformations are in great demand for future wearable power supply devices. In this regard, numerous studies have progressed to implement flexible architecture to high-performance devices such as perovskite solar cells. However, the absence of suitable flexible and stretchable materials has been a great obstacle in the replacement of largely utilized transparent conducting oxides that are limited in flexibility. Here, a shape recoverable polymer, Noland Optical Adhesive 63, is utilized as a substrate of perovskite solar cell to enable complete shape recovery of the device upon sub-millimeter bending radii. The employment of stretchable electrodes prevents mechanical damage of the perovskite layer. Before and after bending at a radius of 1 mm, power conversion efficiency (PCE) is measured to be 10.75% and 10.4%, respectively. Additionally, the shape recoverable device demonstrates a PCE of 6.07% after crumpling. The mechanical properties of all the layers are characterized by nanoindentation. Finite element analysis reveals that the outstanding flexibility of the perovskite layer enables small plastic strain distribution on the deformed device. These results clearly demonstrated that this device has great potential to be utilized in stretchable power supply applications.","6602":"Composites incorporating ferromagnetic components into a highly porous carbon matrix are promising as electromagnetic wave absorption materials; however, the design of a facile preparation process with scaleup potentiality still remains a practical challenge. Herein, a new kind of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic carbonaceous bead-like (MCB) Fe-SA-X composites has been directly prepared using a Fe3+ mediated egg-box structure of renewable sodium alginate as single starting material and a controllable carbonization process; as compared to previous work on carbon-based microwave absorbers, it avoids tedious and time-consuming preparation procedures. It was verified that, according to various characterization results, the atmosphere and temperature for the carbonization of Fe-SA precursors were crucial factors for the formation of the ferromagnetic metal particles and carbon matrix in the porous Fe-SA-X composites. Among the Fe-SA-X composites obtained at different temperatures, FeSA-600 obtained at 600 degrees C exhibited the best performance for electromagnetic wave absorption, for which can be attributed to the synergy of magnetism of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the nano-network of graphitized carbon. The maximum reflection loss (RL) of Fe-SA-600 reached 24 dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) was 4.80 GHz (13.2-18 GHz) corresponding to an absorber thickness of only 1.5 mm. Such excellent electromagnetic absorption properties could be assigned to the improvement of the impedance match and interfacial polarization and unique porous structures, by which can lead to the effective microwave multi-reflection and scattering. This kind of composite is an attractive candidate for new types of high-performance electromagnetic wave-absorbing materials, meeting for the current requirements of wide-band absorption, high efficiency absorption capability, thin thickness and light weight.","4999":"Use of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) has seen rapid growth in recent years, which requires abundant and low-cost electrode materials. Sweet potato is a worldwide dicotyledonous plant and has usually a high yield. In this work, using sweet potatoes as raw materials, carbon nanoparticles were prepared through a hydrothermal carbonization approach followed by high temperature annealing. We demonstrate that with the as-prepared carbon nanoparticles as anode, the lithium ion battery shows a first discharge capacity as high as 965 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1). Considering the bio-renewable advantage and facile fabrication procedure, carbon nanoparticles derived from sweet potatoes could sustainably satisfy the increasing need for anode materials for LIBs.","2245":"The thermal transformations processes of kaolinite (K) in kaolinitic clays is known to consist of a dehydroxylation into metakaolin (MM) at approximate to 600 degrees C, followed by the formation of a spinel type aluminosilicate (SAS) at approximate to 980 degrees C, and finally the development of mullite (M) at higher temperatures (1200-1300 degrees C). The structural characterization of these materials is generally based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, where the XRD features of K and M are well defined due to their crystalline nature, but as consequence of the low crystallinity of MK and SAS, the precise characterization of these phases is not possible using this technique. In this study the nature of aluminum atoms in the different materials obtained by thermal treatments of a kaolinite is investigated using Al K-XANES and compared with other well-known aluminum containing materials. XRD and SEM characterization were also carried out. The results confirm the potentiality of this synchrotron based techniques for the characterization of natural materials and ceramics especially with low crystallinity. Particularly the mullite aluminums Al K-XANES spectra were not reported before. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, increasing the use of biodegradable films and reducing non degradable plastic usage are worldwide necessities. Current biodegradable films are not transparent or strong enough for most applications. In this work we utilize nanocellulose and semiconductor nanocrystals to reinforce and functionalize a biodegradable transparent film to create a transparent, strong and optically tunable plastic film. Nanocrystalline cellulose is produced from cellulose fibers, the main component of plant cell walls. The nanocrystalline cellulose particles are 5-20 nm in diameter, a few hundreds of nanometers in length, and have superb mechanical properties. The optical properties are controlled by introducing nanocrystals within the nanocellulose layers. The hybrid nanocellulose\/nanocrystals film reinforcement will enable the reduction in the amount of plastic polymer in most polymeric materials while maintaining mechanical integrity with additional optical properties.","1158":"Arrays of TiO2 nanofibres (NFs) were successfully prepared by template sol-gel synthesis, using track-etched polycarbonate membranes as structure directing agent. The control of the sol-gel kinetic was crucial in order to homogeneously fill the pores with a continuous framework. For this reason acetylacetone was added to the sol-gel mixture as chelating agent. The band edge positions of TiO2 NFs were determined by a Mott-Schottky plot and diffuse reflectance analysis. The results support the presence of trace dopants which can act favorably with respect to the photoelectrochemical properties. The TiO2 NFs array showed enhanced photoelectrochemical activity both under UV light and visible light when used as photoanodes for the water splitting reaction.","4925":"The influence of aliphatic chain lengths on supramolecular hydrogelation of naphthalene diimide-capped dipeptides is described. The dependence of the gelation pH as a function of chain lengths reveals an inverse linear relationship and the gelation pH values cover a broad range from pH 2 to pH 9. In addition, the presence of a n-octyl tail in the hydrogelator could enhance the ability of self-assembly in dilute solution.","5995":"In this article, a new method is used to fabricate a high-performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which is convenient and cost-effective. A polyformaldehyde (POM) film with novel structures is prepared through electrospinning and is combined with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film to assemble micro-nano structured TENG. The short-circuit current (I-s) and open-circuit voltage (V-o) of the TENG are up to 0.4343 mA and 236.8 V, respectively, and no significant change is observed by applying different frequencies of external impact forces from 1 to 10 Hz. Finally, we successfully drive an electrochromic device (ECD) directly using TENG within just 2 min for the first time.","5884":"This article presents the development of a sustainable ultra-lightweight geopolymer concrete (with a dry density <= 800 kg\/m(3)) for both thermal insulating and load bearing purposes. A predesigned mineral precursor resulted from industrial by-products is used as the raw material for alkali activation and NaOH with a low concentration of 2-3 Misused as the alkali activator, together with a specially designed additive as superplasticizer. The ultra-lightweight property is achieved by applying a waste glass produced expanded lightweight material as aggregates. The effects of influential parameters including the design approach, liquid\/binder ratio, binder\/aggregate ratio, particle size and air entraining agent on the properties of the designed concrete are evaluated. An ultra-lightweight concrete with a proper workability is obtained and the hardened concrete shows excellence performances in terms of mechanical property, thermal property and durability. At a moderate compressive strength (10 MPa), an excellent thermal conductivity of 0.11 W\/(m.K) is resulted. Furthermore, a very low thermal conductivity of 0.07 W\/(m.K) is reached at a compressive strength of 8 MPa, indicating great potential for the production of a load bearing and highly insulating building material as an alternative for the traditional materials.

While the cellulosic fraction of biomass gives access to saccharides only, lignin could possibly give access to low molecular weight aromatic compounds. Strong alkalinity of the reaction medium is necessary in order to dissolve lignin and to obtain an electrically conducting solution. However, strong alkalinity is supposed to be one of the reasons for consecutive oxidations to undesired organic acids and carbon dioxide. The high pH also limits the use of only a few metals as electrode materials. We report the use of pure deep eutectic solvents (DES) in order to dissolve lignin in combination with electrochemical oxidative depolymerisation. We also present successful extraction of the products through liquid-liquid extraction and their characterization by size exclusion chromatography and GC-MS, proving that a successful depolymerisation of lignin was achieved. Guaiacol and vanillin were the two most abundant detected products.","6317":"A naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based new gelator molecule has been discovered, the molecule forms interesting J\/H-aggregated species depending on solvents (aliphatic\/aromatic) and remarkably, the fluorescence of the gel phase materials is nicely tuned according to the electron donating capacity of the aromatic solvent.","4267":"This paper presents fundamental work done to enable fibre reinforcement of roller-compacted concrete (RCC). Procedures for mixing and casting two types of steel fibres in RCC were developed. Fresh properties, uniaxial compressive and bending behaviour were examined in a pilot study dealing with cement content, fibre type and dosage. It was found that different fibre types and dosages require different moisture contents. It is concluded that low cement content (less than 300 kg\/m(3)) steel-fibre-reinforced roller-compacted concrete (SFR-RCC) mixes do not have sufficient paste and are prone to fibre agglomeration, hence SFR-RCC mixes richer in paste and at optimum moisture content are recommended. Mixes with cement content of 300 kg\/m(3) coped better with fibre reinforcement. Despite causing some loss in compressive strength, fibres help enhance the flexural performance and even SFR-RCC mixes with recycled masonry and concrete aggregates performed equally well as natural aggregate mixes. A full-scale trial has been conducted to confirm the findings. This paper is followed by a companion paper dealing with a comprehensive parametric study leading to the development of sigma-epsilon models for SFR-RCC.","2827":"Fibers resulting from pulping of wood are negatively charged by nature. Both the cellulose and hemicelluloses contribute to the anionicity. The negative charge of cellulosic material can be reversed with the same reagent commonly used for the cationization of starch. In this study, a bleached Kraft pulp was cationized in systems with different water-miscible organic solvents. Replacing 90% of the water with isopropanol and particularly with tetrahydrofuran yielded higher degrees of substitution and increased reaction efficiency. The degree of substitution depends on the concentration of the cationization reagent in water; partially replacing water with tetrahydrofuran can simulate a higher concentration while maintaining supramolecular properties, such as crystallinity and polymer chain integrity.","4464":"In this report, in contrast to conventional processes which rely upon non-covalent wrapping, we manipulate the covalent binding of conjugated polymers to carbon nanofibers to synthesize hybrid nanostructures. First, the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction was utilized to introduce carboxyl groups onto the nanofiber sidewalls. Octa-aminophenylsilsesquioxane was then uniformly covalently attached to the carboxylated nanocarbon (CNF-COOH) through amide linkage. Subsequently, the phenylamino groups on the CNF surface were copolymerized with aniline via chemical oxidative polymerization to create a unique CNF-conjugated polymer hybrid (CNFS-PANI), and a binder-free CNF-based composite paper electrode was generated by vacuum-filtration. Morphology investigations revealed the formation of 3D porous interconnected network structures with loosely stacked hyperbranched PANI nanobundles due to the incorporation of OASQ onto the skeleton of CNFs. Such a flexible CNFS-PANI nanohybrid paper further exhibited excellent electric conductivity (0.31 S cm(-1)) and specific capacitance (167 F g(-1)), which is much higher than that of original CNFs (2.5 F g(-1)), suggesting its potential use as an electrochemical electrode material.","3128":"Piezoelectricity and magnetoelectricity are contradictory properties with a rather limited set of natural (often hard) materials that exhibit both. Composite materials - almost always restricted to hard ones - provide a limited recourse with the attendant limitations of small strains, fabrication challenges among others. In this article, using the concept of electrets, we propose a simple scheme to design soft, highly deformable materials that simultaneously exhibit piezoelectricity and magnetoelectricity. We demonstrate that merely by embedding charges and ensuring elastic heterogeneity, the geometrically nonlinear behavior of soft materials leads to an emergent piezoelectric and magnetoelectric behavior. We find that an electret configuration made of sufficiently soft (nonpiezoelectric and nonmagnetic) polymer foams can exhibit simultaneous magnetoelectricity and piezoelectricity with large coupling constants that exceed the best-known ceramic composites. Moreover, we show that these properties can be tuned with the action of an external field.","7373":"In this study, grafted sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde lignin (GSL) was prepared via graft sulfonation using alkali lignin from pulping black liquor as a raw material and studied by GPC, functional group content measurement and FTIR to confirm its fundamental structure. Unexpected cluster-induced green fluorescent emission of sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde polymer in GSL, an unconventional chromophore, was investigated for the first time. Moreover, inspired by the phenolic hydroxyl group of GSL, we studied the electron transfer process during the oxidation of GSL by cyclic voltammetry and hole transporting mobility test. Electrochemical behaviour test showed an oxidation potential at 1.1 V. Moreover, a hole mobility of 2.27 x 10(-6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) was detected with GSL as the hole transport material. The results reveal that GSL is a potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductor. Taking advantage of the hole transporting property of GSL, PEDOT:GSLs with controllable work functions were developed and applied as hole transport layers (HTLs) in organic electronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). As a result, a maximum power efficiency of 14.67 lm W-1 was achieved with PEDOT: GSL-1 : 6 as HTL in OLEDs, which was 1.78 times that with PEDOT: PSS (8.25 lm W-1). Moreover, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.47% using PEDOT: GSL-1 : 4 as HTL was achieved in the OPV devices structure of ITO\/HTL\/PTB7-Th:PC71BM\/PFN\/Al. These results show that amorphous polymer GSL might be a potential dopant of PEDOT in organic electronic devices and it provides a novel perspective to adjust the work function of PEDOT by doping with sulfonated lignin, which is a cheap and renewable biomass.","1436":"It is desirable but challenging to develop active and durable low-Pt catalysts for next-generation fuel cells. Herein, a three-dimensional porous PtPdCu architecture with ultrathin nanowires was obtained through a simple, rapid and aqueous method. This PtPdCu catalyst showed the remarkable performance for methanol oxidation reaction with a 6.5 times enhancement in precious-metal-based mass activity, a 7.2 times enhancement in specific activity and a better durability in comparison with a standard Pt\/C catalyst. According to the structure activity analysis, these enhancements were due to the beneficial structural feature and the multicomponent synergy effect.","904":"A facile and high-throughput strategy is presented to fabricate three-dimensional hierarchically porous Au films with good flexibility and transferability via displacement reaction of a Ag-coated electrospun nanofiber template. The films are constructed by mesoporous Au nanotubes, homogeneous in the macroscale but rough and porous in the nanoscale. Each nanotube-block is micro\/nanostructured with evenly distributed mesopores on the tubewalls. Further experiments have revealed that the Ag sputtering time and displacement reaction conditions are the key influential factors determining the film architecture. Such structured film has exhibited significant surface-enhanced Raman scattering activity with good stability and reproducibility and shown the possibility of molecule-level detection. Additionally, the strategy is general for fabricating other hierarchically porous Au films, such as mesoporous Au hollow sphere arrays.","7030":"The chemically and structurally highly stable polyoxometalate (POM) single-molecule magnet (SMM) [(FeW9O34)(2)Fe-4(H2O)(2)](10-) (Fe6W18) has been incorporated by direct or post-synthetic approaches into a biopolymer gelatin (Gel) matrix and two crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), including one diamagnetic (UiO-67) and one magnetic (MIL-101(Cr)). Integrity of the POM in the Fe6W18@Gel, Fe6W18@UiO-67 and Fe6W18@MIL-101(Cr) composites was confirmed by a set of complementary techniques. Magnetic studies indicate that the POMs are magnetically well isolated. Remarkably, in Fe6W18@Gel, the SMM properties of the embedded molecules are close to those of the crystals, with clear quantum tunneling steps in the hysteresis loops. For the Fe6W18@UiO-67 composite, the molecules retain their SMM properties, the energy barrier being slightly reduced in comparison to the crystalline material and the molecules exhibiting a tunneling rate of magnetization significantly faster than for Fe6W18@Gel. When Fe6W18 is introduced into MIL-101(Cr), the width of the hysteresis loops is drastically reduced and the quantum tunneling steps are smeared out because of the magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic matrix and the SMM guest molecules.","5324":"3D hierarchical carbon-based nanostructures not only create hierarchical porous channels, but also possess high electrical conductivity and maintain excellent structural mechanical stability for high-performance supercapacitors. In this research, hierarchical porous N-doped carbon and Co3O4 nanopillar arrays derived from Morpho butterfly wing scales have been explored. These structures have demonstrated enhanced capacitance, with a maximum specific capacity of 978.9 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), and good cycling stability, retaining about 94.5% of their capacitance after 2000 cycles as well as improving supercapacitor energy density without sacrificing power density. The maximum energy density of the carbonized wing scale-cobalt oxide (CWs-Co3O4) composite supercapacitors was found to be 99.11 Wh kg(-1). This paper proposes a method for building 3D hierarchical N-doped carbon materials with various morphologies.

Among various nano-composites, manganese dioxide-core-shell hyperbranched chitosan (MnO2-HBCs) provided rapid and high efficiency direct electron transfer from the redox active centre of an immobilized enzyme and screen printed electrode. The assay optimization was achieved after testing the effects of several factors such as type of crosslinking agent, accumulation potential, toxicity of heavy metals and interferences on the bioactivity of GOx. Results demonstrated sensitivity of the proposed method to detect inhibition effects of metal ions and also the response of agents interfering with glucose measurement. A chronoamperometric calibration curve was obtained, and the oxidation current of the enzymatically produced H2O2 was linearly dependent on glucose concentration with a detection limit of 7 mu g mL(-1). Thus, the clinical determination of glucose concentration was performed on blood samples and the results were correlated with a reference method. In conclusion, the current study suggests a new class of electrochemical biosensors and paves the way for further promising applications.","6437":"Non-oxidative graphene (nOG) synthesized from natural graphite powder was modified with magnetite (Fe3O4) for removal of Cr(VI) and dyes in aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) on Fe3O4\/nOG (M-nOG) was systematically investigated, and the simultaneous adsorption of Cr(VI) and dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) was evaluated. Adsorption kinetic and isotherm of Cr(VI) were fitted well with pseudo-second-order model and Sips model, respectively. For the binary system, Cr(VI) removal was not affected with increasing the dye concentration, whereas the adsorption capacity of both MB and RhB was enhanced with increasing the concentrations of Cr(VI).","1740":"The adsorption behavior of Alizarin red S (ARS) from aqueous solution onto magnetic activated carbon (MAC) nano-composite was investigated under various experimental conditions. Characterization of the obtained MAC nano-composite was achieved by FT-IR, BET, FE-SEM, EDX, XRD and VSM techniques. The influence of variables including pH, concentration of the dye, amount of adsorbents and contact time was investigated by the batch method. High maximum adsorption capacity was obtained at 108.69 mg g(-1) for ARS. The equilibrium data was evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. The Langmuir model best describes the uptake of ARS dye, which implies that the adsorption of ARS dye onto MAC nano-composite is homogeneous. The kinetic data were analyzed using Lagergren pseudo-first order and pseudo-second equation. The pseudo-second order exhibited the best fit for the kinetic studies (R-2=0.9999), which indicates that adsorption of ARS is limited by chemisorption process. This study shows that the as-prepared MAC composite could be utilized as an efficient, magnetically separable adsorbent for the environmental cleanup. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AGEs are both consumed and endogenously formed; their accumulation is accelerated under hyperglycemic and oxidative stress conditions, and they are associated with the onset and complication of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. AGEs exert their deleterious effects by either accumulating, in the circulation and tissues or by receptor-mediated signal transduction. Several receptors-bind AGEs: some are specific and contribute to clearance of AGEs, whereas others, like the RAGE receptor, are nonspecific, associated with inflammation.. and oxidative stress, and considered to be mediators Of the aforementioned AGE-related diseases. Although several anti-AGE compounds have been studied, understanding the underlying mechanisms of RAGE and targeting it as a therapeutic strategy is becoming increasingly desirable. For achieving these goals efficiently and expeditiously, the C. elegans model has been suggested. This model is already used for studying several, human diseases and, by expressing RAGE, could also be used to Study RAGE-related pathways and pathologies to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","6576":"Nanostructured multicomponent metal selenide materials and their carbon composite materials have been studied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Hierarchically structured (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2 nanofibers with fiber-in-tube nanostructures and (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2-C composite nanofibers with filled structures were prepared by electrospinning with subsequent selenization. Selenization of the CoFe2O4 nanofibers formed rod-type (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2 nanocrystals, and the tube-in-tube nanostructures of the nanofibers transformed into fiber-in-tube structures during this process. The discharge capacities of the hierarchically structured (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2 nanofibers and (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2-Se-C composite nanofibers were 594 and 512 mA h g(-1) (for the 60th cycle at a current density of 0.3 A g(-1)), respectively, and their corresponding capacity retentions measured from the 2nd cycle were almost 100%. The reversible discharge capacity of the hierarchically structured (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2 nanofibers decreased slightly from 585 to 497 mA h g(-1) as the current density was increased from 0.1 to 5.0 A g(-1). However, the reversible discharge capacity of the (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2-Se-C composite nanofibers decreased from 543 to 359 mA h g(-1) as the current density was increased from 0.1 to 5.0 A g(-1). The uniquely structured (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2 nanofibers with fiber-in-tube structures and featuring highly crystallized ultrafine nanorods (which have high electrical conductivity) showed superior rate performance compared to the (Co1\/3Fe2\/3)Se-2-Se-C composite nanofibers with filled structures.","2303":"The transversal dimension of electrospun fibers depends on a multitude of technological, constructive and environment factors and not finally, on the characteristics of polymeric solution. This study has examined the effect of the nozzle sizes on the diameter of the fibers of 12% polyetherimide (PEI) solution using as solvent dimethyl acetamide \/tetrahydrofuran (DMAC\/THF), 1:1 ratio. The polymer solution was processed at two values of nozzle size, and the voltage, feed rate and spinning distance were also varied. Processing with different parameters resulted in the production of fibers with diameters varying between 208 and 738nm. When the diameter of the nozzle size of the needle decreases, the surface tension of the drop increases and diminishes the resulted fibers diameter.","2333":"Light-responsive agents offer the promise of targeted therapy, whose benefits include (i) prolonged action at the target site, (ii) overall reduced systemic dosage, (iii) reduced adverse effects, and (iv) localized delivery of multiple agents. Although photoactivated prodrugs have been reported, these species generally require short wavelengths (<450 nm) for activation. However, maximal tissue penetrance by light occurs within the \"optical window of tissue\" (600-900 nm), well beyond the wavelength range of most existing photo-cleavable functional groups. Furthermore, since multidrug therapy holds promise for the treatment of complex diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, controlling the action of multiple drugs via wavelength modulation would take advantage of a property that is unique to light. However, discrimination between existing photoresponsive moieties has thus far proven to be limited. We have developed a vitamin B-12\/light-facilitated strategy for controlling drug action using red, far-red, and NIR light. The technology is based on a light-triggered reaction displayed by a subset of B-12 derivatives: alkyl-cob(III)alamins suffer photohomolysis of the C-Co(III) bond. The C-Co(III) bond is weak (<30 kcal\/mol), and therefore all wavelengths absorbed by the corrin ring (330-580 nm) induce photodeavage. In addition, by appending fluorophores to the corrin ring, long wavelength light (>600 nm) is readily captured and used to separate the Co-appended ligand (e.g., a drug) from B-12. Consequently, it is now feasible to preassign the wavelength of homolysis by simply installing a fluorescent antenna with the desired photophysical properties. The wavelength malleability inherent within this strategy has been used to construct photoresponsive compounds that launch different drugs by simply modulating the wavelength of illumination. In addition, these phototherapeutics have been installed on the surface and interior of cells, such as erythrocytes or neural stem cells, and released upon expoure to the appropriate wavelength. We have shown that cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin, anti-inflammatories, such as dexamethasone, and anti- and pro-vascular agents are readily released from cellular vehicles as biologically active agents. We have also demonstrated that the concept of \"optical window of tissue\" phototherapeutics is not just limited to prodrugs. For example, stem cells have received considerable attention in the area of regenerative medicine. Hydrogels serve as scaffolds for stem cell growth and differentiation. We have shown that the formation of hydrogels can be triggered, in the presence of cells, using appropriately designed alkyl-cob(III)alamins and long wavelength light. The potential applications of phototherapeutics are broad and include drug delivery for a variety of indications, tissue engineering, and surgery.","7472":"The tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a promising material with important technologic and scientific applications, due to its electrochromic, gasochromic and photochromic properties. Usually, this material is synthesized following several routes, for example, sputtering, chemical deposition, sol-gel, hydrothermal, among others. However, these methods are complicated, have long processing times and use several chemicals with the possibility of keeping undesirable impurities. In this context, concentrated solar energy is an interesting and feasible option to process materials at a low cost and without greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, a simple and green synthesis method of WO3 by using the Solar Furnace of the Renewable Energy Institute of the National University of Mexico is presented. Tungsten oxide powder is obtained by means of tungsten electrodes in a high-temperature solar reaction chamber designed to work with concentrated solar energy under controlled conditions of the gas atmosphere. The oxidation reaction was carried out for three different temperatures: 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, and for each temperature three different oxygen molar fractions were studied: 0.33, 0.41 and 1. Some results indicate the oxygen molar fraction does not affect the phase transformation and the WO3 triclinic was the most stable phase, appearing in all the temperature ranges and concentrations. The synthesis reported in this paper is presented as a green alternative in the development of processes for the synthesis of WO3, which promote renewable energy sources with very low greenhouse gas emissions and without toxic residuals.","5437":"Hierarchically coaxial carbon nanofiber\/NiO (CNF\/NiO) core-shell nanocables for lithium ion batteries are prepared to coat alpha-Ni(OH)(2) on the surface of electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNF) by electrophoretic deposition, followed by thermal processing in air. In the coaxial CNF\/NiO nanocables, a NiO shell of about 20 nm thick is formed by coating with nano-furs outward on the surface of a CNF core of 200 nm in diameter, which is the main factor for providing a three-dimensional (3D) structure. The NiO shells, comprising of abundant inner spaces on the surface of CNF and high conductivity of 1D CNF, are deeply dependent on the enhancement of electrochemical rate capability. Abundant inner spaces in the NiO shell and the interconnected network between nanocables facilitate the mass transfer. The CNF core with the cushioning effect created through the elastic deformation provides electrochemical stability by protecting both radial compression and volume expansion originating from NiO shells radially. The CNF\/NiO nanocables deliver a high reversible capacity of 825 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 50 charge-discharge cycles without showing obvious decay. The coaxial CNF\/NiO nanocables increase not only electrochemical capability but also electrochemical stability.","4343":"Three-dimensional (3D) nanocarbon architectures have attracted great interest in materials science and nanotechnology. In this work, we report the synthesis of a 3D nitrogen-doped graphene nanoarchitecture by using catalytic carbonization of aromatic polyimide (PI) on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanowires. The produced porous graphene nanofibers are crosslinked into an integrated monolithic structure, thereby offering continuous electron conductivity and efficient charge transport. Moreover, nitrogen doping was achieved during the in situ carbonization, enhancing the electronic and interfacial properties of the porous graphene nanofibers. The obtained monolithic frameworks were directly used as binder-free electrodes for lithium batteries, and yield remarkable electrochemical performances, such as high reversible capacity, high rate capability, and superb cycling stability. The monolithic structures can be used as a material platform for the preparation of other functional composites, extending their applications beyond energy storage.","5252":"A composite cathode material consisting of (010) facet-oriented LiFePO4 nanoplatelets wrapped in a nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel is reported. Such a composite possesses a 3D porous structure with a BET surface area as high as 199.3 m(2) g(-1). In this composite, the nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel combined with its interconnected porous networks provides pathways for rapid electron transfer and ion transport, while the thin LFP nanoplatelets with large (010) surface area enhance the active sites and shorten the Li+ diffusion distances. As a result, a high rate capability (78 mA h g(-1) at 100 C) as well as a long life cycling stability (89% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 10 C) are achieved.","5492":"In the last decade, research studies have increased on the development of delivery systems for polyphenols, for protection, improvement of stability and increase of their bioavailability. Rosmarinic acid is a polyphenol with described bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-bacterial and anti-viral capabilities. Thus, the aim of this research work was to produce stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) using carnauba wax as lipidic matrix, for delivery of rosmarinic acid, to be further incorporated into food matrices. Hence, different concentrations of wax (0.5, 1 and 1.5%, w\/v) and percentages of surfactant (1, 2 and 3%, v\/v) were tested. Physical properties, surface morphology and association efficiencies were studied at time of production and after 28 day at refrigerated storage. Thermal properties and the nature of the chemical interactions between the lipids waxes and rosmarinic acid were also evaluated. The particles showed range size between 35-927 nm and zeta potentials of ca. -38 to 40, showing high stability, with no risk of aggregation due to electric repulsion of SLN. High association efficiencies % (ca. 99%) were obtained. FTIR analyses proved the association of rosmarinic acid and lipidic matrix. The low lipid and high surfactant concentrations leads to small SLN. The surfactant, polysorbate 80 decreases the interfacial tension in the SLN surfaces, preventing aggregation, leading to the development of small particles. These properties were maintained throughout the 28 day of refrigerated storage, and no rosmarinic acid was released by the particles during refrigeration, indicating good compatibility between rosmarinic acid and the waxy core of SLN. The optimum range values to obtain the desirable features for incorporation in a functional food suggest formulations containing 1.0 and 1.5% (w\/v) of lipid and 2% (v\/v) of surfactant.","4557":"Chlorophyll is a pyrrolic pigment with important optical properties, which is the reason it has been studied for many years. Recently, interest has been rising with respect to this molecule because of its outstanding physicochemical properties, particularly applicable to the design and development of luminescent materials, hybrid sensor systems, and photodynamic therapy devices for the treatment of cancer cells and bacteria. More recently, our research group has been finding evidence for the possibility of preserving these important properties of substrates containing chlorophyll covalently incorporated within solid pore matrices, such as SiO2, TiO2 or ZrO2 synthesized through the sol-gel process. In this work, we study the optical properties of silica xerogels organo-modified on their surface with allyl and phenyl groups and containing different concentrations of chlorophyll bonded to the pore walls, in order to optimize the fluorescence that these macrocyclic species displays in solution. The intention of this investigation was to determine the maximum chlorophyll a concentration at which this molecule can be trapped inside the pores of a given xerogel and to ascertain if this pigment remains trapped as a monomer, a dimer, or aggregate. Allyl and phenyl groups were deposited on the surface of xerogels in view of their important effects on the stability of the molecule, as well as over the fluorescence emission of chlorophyll; however, these organic groups allow the trapping of either chlorophyll a monomers or dimers. The determination of the above parameters allows finding the most adequate systems for subsequent in vitro or in vivo studies. The characterization of the obtained xerogels was performed through spectroscopic absorption, emission and excitation spectra. These hybrid systems can be employed as mimics of natural systems; the entrapment of chlorophyll inside pore matrices indicates that it is possible to exploit some of the most physicochemical properties of trapped chlorophyll for diverse technological applications. The data herein collected suggest the possibility of applying the developed methodology to other active, captive molecules in order to synthesize new hybrid materials with optimized properties, suitable to be applied in diverse technological fields.","1867":"Sustainable synthesis schemes for the production of porous carbons with appropriate textural properties for use as super-capacitor electrodes are in high demand. In this work a greener option to the widely used but corrosive KOH is proposed for the production of highly porous carbons. Hydrochar products are used as carbon precursors. It is demonstrated that a mild alkaline potassium salt such as potassium bicarbonate is very effective to generate porosity in hydrochar to lead to materials with large surface areas (>2000 m(2)g(-1)) and a tunable pore size distribution. Furthermore, the use of KHCO3 instead of KOH gives rise to a significant 10% increase in the yield of activated carbon, and the spherical morphology of hydrochar is retained, which translates into better packing properties and reduced ion diffusion distances. These features lead to a super-capacitor performance that can compete with, and even surpass, that of KOH-activated hydrochar in a variety of electrolytes.","254":"A magnetic nanoparticle@starch-g-poly(vinyl sulfate) nanocomposite (MNP@St-g-PVS) as a new magnetic nano-adsorbent has been prepared based on graft copolymerization of vinyl acetate onto starch in the presence of magnetic nanoparticles, where the acetate groups were converted to hydroxyl groups followed by the sulfation of the hydroxyl groups using chlorosulfonic acid. Characterization of this magnetic nanocomposite was carried out by FTIR, TGA, XRD, VSM, SEM, TEM and elemental analysis. The resulting nanocomposite was used as an adsorbent for the removal of typical cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG), from aqueous solutions. All experimental parameters that can affect the adsorption behavior, including the pH of the dye solution, initial dye concentration, contact time and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, study of the kinetics and isotherm adsorption indicated that the adsorption process is well fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models, respectively. The MNP@St-g-PVS magnetic nano-adsorbent showed remarkable adsorption capacities in the removal of cationic dyes (621 mg g(-1) for MB and 567 mg g(-1) for MG), compared to most of the other adsorbents. It is worth noting that the prepared adsorbent has a robust structure and could be recovered without a significant loss of adsorption ability.","4409":"Using a bio-inspired cellulose template, new charge transfer (CT) nanoparticles (NPs) with unique and intriguing emission properties are reported. Pyrene-modified 2,3-di-O-methyl cellulose formed CT complexes with small molecule acceptors, e.g. 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), and exhibited aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in aqueous medium upon nanoparticle formation. The TCNQ-CT NPs showed multicolor fluorescence emissions at 370-400 nm, 602 nm and 777 nm, when excited at 330 nm, 485 nm and 620 nm respectively. The cellulose-TCNQ NPs are biocompatible and demonstrate an advance in the use of the CT mechanism for biomedical imaging applications both in vitro and in vivo.","4254":"Humin by-products are formed during the acid-catalyzed dehydration of carbohydrates to bio-based platform molecules, such as hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid. The molecular structure of these humins has not yet been unequivocally established. 1D C-13 solid-state NMR data reported have, for example, provided considerable insight, but do not allow for the unambiguous assignment of key structural motifs. Complementary (2D) techniques are needed to gain additional insight into the molecular structure of humins. Here, the preparation of C-13-enriched humins is reported, together with the reactive solubilization of these labeled humins and their characterization with complementary 1D and 2D solid-state NMR techniques. 1D cross polarization (CP) and direct excitation (DE) C-13 solid-state NMR spectra, 2D C-13-detected double-quantum single-quantum (DQSQ) as well as 2D H-1-detected heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) were recorded with different excitation schemes. These experiments unambiguously established that the original humins have a furan-rich structure with aliphatic linkers and allowed for a refinement of the molecular structure proposed previously. Solid-state NMR data of alkali-treated C-13-labeled humins showed that an arene-rich structure is formed at the expense of the furanic network during alkaline pretreatment.","221":"An urchin-like Ni3ZnC0.7-carbon nanotube-porous carbon composite was synthesized, for the first time, by one-step direct thermolysis of a metal-organic gel in a conventional horizontal tube furnace without using any additional carrier gas or catalyst.

Evaluation of the accelerating particles supported themechanism of propelling viscous forces (50- 200 nN) fromrectified pyrolysis vapors, thus providing the first example of biomass conveyors with no moving parts driven by high temperature for biofuel reactors.","107":"Porous carbon was prepared through KOH activation of a chitosan - a nitrogen rich precursor. The porosity and surface area strongly depend on the temperature of activation. Different electrolytes were tested to select the most suitable one for electrochemical capacitors with obtained activated carbon as electrode material, and the acidic medium, i.e. 1 M H2SO4 was chosen. The activated carbon prepared with the temperature of activation standing at 750 degrees C exhibits the largest specific surface area and capacitance of 295 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) in the acidic medium. Moreover, the activated carbon from chitosan shows good rate capability and excellent cycling stability (almost 99% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Presently, that mainly focused on the surface modification of negative materials by micro\/nano structure, however, rarely for the positive materials. Here, we presented a simple, low-cost and multifunctional TENG based on the porous micro-nickel foam (PMNF) for harvesting the natural vibration energy. With the surface modification of PMNF with the positive polarity, the newly designed TENG produced an open-circuit voltage up to 187.8 V and a short-circuit current of 71.9 mu A with the peak power density of 3.7 W\/m(2) at the resonance frequency of 13.9 Hz by harvesting vibration energy. This TENG could simultaneously and continuously light up 100 commercial light-emitting diode bulbs. Additionally, by the footfalls force of about 500 N, the corresponding open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current were as high as 403 V and 336 mu A, respectively. The newly designed TENG can be used for the self-powdered floor by footfalls and also for powering some wireless electronics by harvesting the vibration energy from highways, railways, and tunnels in remote mountain areas.

The composite has an interconnected 3D porous network, and the Fe3O4 nanoparticles with the size of similar to 13 nm are uniformly dispersed onto the graphene sheets. Due to the synergistic effects of the assembled graphene sheets and Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the resultant G\/Fe3O4 exhibited efficient adsorption for organic pollutant using Rhodamine B as the adsorbate and electromagnetic wave absorption. The maximum removal ratio of Rhodamine B was 99.6%, and the G\/Fe3O4 hydrogel demonstrated wide and strong wave absorption achieved in the frequency range of 2-20 GHz.

Elucidating the mechanisms of their interaction and transformation is the key to understand medical applicability and functioning feasibility of these oligonucleotides. In this study, the molecular structure and interfacial transformation kinetics of guanine-rich oligonudeotides at model cell membrane were investigated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) in real time and in situ. The conformations of oligonudeotides are obtained by analyzing the SFG spectra in the \"fingerprint\" region. The results indicate that the electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction are both important to the interfacial adsorption and transformation of oligonudeotides. The tilt angles of oligonucleotides with different conformations were also calculated. Molecular insights into interfacial oligonudeotides will help researchers to control the oligonudeotide lipid membrane interactions in a desired manner and improve the reproductivity, stability, and reversibility of oligonudeotide-based applications.","2760":"Nanoparticles (NPs) from biopolymers, in particular polysaccharides, attract much attention but they are rarely systematically investigated in comparison to NPs from synthetic polymers. In this report, stable aqueous suspensions of NPs from cellulose alkyl esters with different alkyl chain lengths (cellulose stearoyl, lauroyl, and caproyl ester) and degrees of substitution (DS) are fabricated via nanoprecipitation. Their properties are investigated in terms of the average size, surface charge and polarity, temperature-responsive crystalline structure, and dry-state morphology, in relationship with the chemical compositions of cellulose esters. Generally, the average diameters of NPs increase with higher DS and longer alkyl chains length, but the surface hydrophobicity decreases with longer alkyl chain length. The presence of the crystallizable stearoyl groups along polymeric backbones renders polymeric NPs with reversibly temperature-responsive property. The NPs from cellulose stearoyl esters (CSE) with stearoyl groups of high contents (DS of 1.3 and 3) and poly(vinyl stearate) can be altered between more crystalline, solid nanospheres, and amorphous, liquid nanodroplets without the loss of their stability by changing the temperature. In comparison, NPs from CSE with a low DS of 0.3, cellulose lauroyl and caproyl ester contain only slightly ordered structure.","1671":"We explored for the first time the ability of a three-dimensional polyacrylonitrile\/ZnO material-prepared by a combination of electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a new material with a large surface area-to enhance the performance of optical sensors for volatile organic compound (VOC) detection. The photoluminescence (PL) peak intensity of these one-dimensional nanostructures has been enhanced by a factor of 2000 compared to a flat Si substrate. In addition, a phase transition of the ZnO ALD coating from amorphous to crystalline has been observed due to the properties of a polyacrylonitrile nanofiber template: surface strain, roughness, and an increased number of nucleation sites in comparison with a flat Si substrate. The greatly improved PL performance of these nanostructured surfaces could produce exciting materials for implantation in VOC optical sensor applications.","4963":"This paper describes an approach to actuate magnetically arrays of microtissue constructs for long-term mechanical conditioning and subsequent biomechanical measurements. Each construct consists of cell\/matrix material self-assembled around a pair of flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) pillars. The deflection of the pillars reports the tissues' contractility. Magnetic stretching of individual microtissues via magnetic microspheres mounted on the cantilevers has been used to elucidate the tissues' elastic modulus and response to varying mechanical boundary conditions. This paper describes the fabrication of arrays of micromagnetic structures that can transduce an externally applied uniform magnetic field to actuate simultaneously multiple microtissues. These structures are fabricated on silicon-nitride coated Si wafers and contain electrodeposited Ni bars. Through-etched holes provide optical and culture media access when the devices are mounted on the PDMS microtissue scaffold devices. Both static and AC forces (up to 20 mu N on each microtissue) at physiological frequencies are readily generated in external fields of 40 mT. Operation of the magnetic arrays was demonstrated via measurements of elastic modulus and dynamic stiffening in response to AC actuation of fibroblast populated collagen microtissues.","1891":"The endurance of a high-speed railway asphalt concrete reinforced trackbed is improved through the use of various percentages of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) slag to replace the coarse natural gravel aggregate of asphalt concrete (replacement rate is 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively). We evaluated the performance of BOF-asphalt concrete (which is used as a reinforced trackbed) by performing a modified penetration test, dynamic triaxial test, tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST), thermal conductivity test, and dynamic model test. The results show that the penetration time is an alternative index, and all of the BOF-asphalt concretes have a waterproof function. With the increase in the BOF replacement rate, the vibration attenuation, bearing capability, antifreeze capability, and insulation effect are improved, while with the BOF replacement rate increase, the flexural tensile strength loss rate is increased during the long term freeze-thaw cycles.

Photonic materials rely upon precise control over the composition and morphology to establish periodic interactions with light on the wavelength and sub-wavelength length scales. Supramolecular assembly provides a natural solution allowing the encoding of a desired 3D architecture into the chemical building blocks and assembly conditions. The compatibility with solution processing and low-overhead manufacturing is a significant advantage over more complex approaches such as lithography or colloidal assembly. Here we review recent advances on photonic architectures derived from block copolymers and highlight the influence and complexity of processing pathways. Notable examples that have emerged from this unique synthesis platform include Bragg reflectors, antireflective coatings, and chiral metamaterials. We further predict expanded photonic capabilities and limits of these approaches in light of future developments of the field.","5451":"We have recently identified a toll-like receptor (TLR4)-interacting SPA4 peptide encoding amino acids: GDFRYSDGTPVNYTNWYRGE, a shorter region of human surfactant protein-A (SP-A). The SPA4 peptide suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation (JPET 2011, Innate Immun 2013). In this report, we examined the structure of synthetic SPA4 peptide in solution by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The CD analysis revealed that the SPA4 peptide is composed of similar to 35% beta sheet and <5% alpha helix. We used solution NMR to solve the structure of the SPA4 peptide. We calculated NMR structures using Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) distance restraints. The superposition of the low energy structures indicated that the central 6-14 amino acids \"SDGTPVNYT\" of the 20-mer SPA4 peptide form a turn, and amino acids on either side (GDFRY and NWYRGE) conform to flexible arms. Furthermore, thermal denaturation experiments demonstrated the structural flexibility of the peptide. The NMR structures of the SPA4 peptide align well with the homologous region within the available structure of rat SP-A and a computationally-docked model of SP-A-TLR4-MD2 protein complex. Together, our results support the structural adaptability of SPA4 peptide for binding to TLR4.","4161":"Due to the ultra-high thermal conductivity (k) of graphene, graphene-based materials are expected to be good thermal conductors. Here, however, we uncovered extremely low k of ultralight graphene aerogels (GAs). Although our GA (similar to 4 mg cm(-3)) is about two times heavier than air (similar to 1.2 mg cm(-3)), the k (4.7 x 10(-3)-5.9 x 10(-3) W m(-1) K-1) at room temperature (RT) is about 80% lower than that of air (0.0257 W m(-1) K-1 at 20 degrees C). At low temperatures, the GA's k reaches a lower level of 2 x 10(-4)-4 x 10(-4) W m(-1) K-1. This is the lowest k ever measured to our best knowledge. The mechanism of this extremely low k is explored by studying the temperature variation of GA's k, thermal diffusivity (alpha) and specific heat (c(p)) from RT to as low as 10.4 K. The uncovered small, yet positive partial derivative alpha\/partial derivative T reveals the dominant interface thermal contact resistance in thermal transport. For normal materials with thermal transport sustained by phonon-phonon scattering, partial derivative alpha\/partial derivative T always remains negative. The study of c(p) suggests highly disordered and amorphous structure of GAs, which also contributes to the ultralow k. This makes the GA a very promising thermal insulation material, especially under vacuum conditions (e.g. astronautics areas). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The improvement of the mechanical properties was accomplished by cross-linking the silica surface with triacrylate cross-linker. A solvent exchange carried out by soaking the gels in a low surface tension solvent allowed to avoid the nonsafe and costly supercritical drying process. In this context, two different sets of aerogel-like monoliths have been produced, and their main properties, namely, bulk density, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity, were studied and modeled using the statistical Central Composite Design (CCD) approach. The empirical models derived for each property of the aerogel-like monoliths lead to further evaluation of the desirability function and optimization of silica aerogel-like properties. The key properties of the optimized APD monoliths were compared with the supercritical dried aerogels with the same synthesis conditions. Finally, the suitability of optimized silica aerogel-like and aerogel monoliths for intended space applications were further investigated by conducting several standard tests. The improved properties of the obtained APD aerogel-like monoliths render them attractive for high-technology applications, and, due to the low energy consumption of the synthesis process, they are competitive with their supercritically dried (SCD) counterparts, by presenting a best value-for-money compromise.","3708":"Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is widely used for making biomaterials. Usually, organic solvents, such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), or acids (H3PO4, HAc) have been used to disperse collagen to make collagen-based biomaterials. However, the native structure of collagen is often seriously damaged and the concentration of collagen in solution was always relatively low, which greatly limited its application. In this work, we have firstly made a detailed study of the effect of H+ and HAc on collagen dispersal in terms of Zeta potential, particle size and Circular Dichroism (CD), followed by using a benign sodium acetate\/acetic acid buffer solution, which is proposed to disperse the collagen. The results showed that the collagen solution from a NaAc\/HAc buffer solution at pH = 3.0 had both high concentration (100 mg mL(-1)) and perfect native structure preservation (up to 94%). We demonstrated that it was the constant concentration of free H+ in the NaAc\/HAc buffer solution whose pH was fixed at 3.0 that can maintain an unchanged amount of surface charge on the collagen colloidal particles, which enables the collagen to be dispersed well even at high dose. As an application, the collagen solution from the NaAc\/HAc solution at pH 3.0 was successfully electrospun into nanofibers, and the obtained collagen nanofibers can still maintain as much as 57% of its native structure. This study indicated that the novel buffer solution of NaAc\/HAc at pH 3.0 could be commonly used in the processing of collagen for a variety of biomaterials based on collagen solutions, and has great potential for use in tissue engineering.","6749":"The last five years have witnessed a huge breakthrough in the creation and the study of the properties of a new class of compounds -metamaterials. The next stage of this technological revolution will be the development of active, controllable, and non-linear metamaterials, surpassing natural media as platforms for optical data processing and quantum information applications. However, scientists are constantly faced with the need to find new methods that can ensure the formation of quantum and non-linear metamaterials with higher resolution. One such method of producing metamaterials in the future, which will provide scalability and availability, is chemical synthesis. Meanwhile, the chemical synthesis of organized 3D structures with a period of a few nanometers and a size of up to a few millimeters is not an easy task and is yet to be resolved. The most promising avenue seems to be the use of highly porous structures based on metalorganic frameworks that have demonstrated their unique properties in the field of non-linear optics ( NLO) over the past three years. Thus, the aim of this review is to examine current progress and the possibilities of using metal-organic frameworks in the field of non-linear optics as chemically obtained metamaterials of the future. The review begins by presenting the theoretical principles of physical phenomena represented by mathematical descriptions for clarity. Major attention is paid to the second harmonic generation ( SHG) effect. In this section we compare inorganic single crystals, which are most commonly used to study the effect in question, to organic materials, which also possess the required properties. Based on these data, we present a rationale for the possibility of studying the non-linear optical properties of metal-organic structures as well as describing the use of synthetic approaches and the difficulties associated with them. The second part of the review explicitly acquaints the reader with a new class of materials which successfully combines the positive properties of organic and inorganic materials. Using recently synthesized metalorganic frameworks and coordination polymers in the field of non-linear optics as an example, we consider synthetic approaches used for obtaining materials with desired properties and the factors to be considered in this case. Finally, probable trends towards improving the quality of the synthesized materials with regards to their further use in the field of non-linear optical effects are described.","1563":"Preparing nitrogen-doped porous carbons directly from waste biomass has received considerable interest for the purpose of realizing the atomic economy.

Successful composite formation was determined from a structural study like XRD and chemical analyses like FTIR and XPS. FESEM and TEM observations of the manganese cobaltite compound reveal the flower like architecture formed by the clusters of MnCo204.5 nanowires. By graphene incorporation a unique hybrid 1-D\/2-D nanostructure was developed in the composite material. BET surface area measurement reveals the extremely high surface area of the composite material owing to its distinct morphology. CV measurements reveal the excellent redox reactivity of the prepared electrode materials. GMC exhibited a high specific capacitance of 890 F g-1 which upon activation over cycling increases to 934 F g(-1). MnCo204.5 decorated graphene sheets in the composite provide high interfacial sites for the redox process, exceptional electrical support and mechanical strength during cycling. The manganese cobaltite-graphene composite was able to retain 95% of its original capacitance at the end of 2000 cycles. The small solution resistance value of 1.21 illustrates the superior conductivity of the composite material. A symmetrical cell fabricated using the GMC electrode material exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 189 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) scan rate. Fast reaction kinetics displayed by the cell were due to the charge transfer speedway provided by the graphene sheets. The superior performance of the hybrid composite makes it a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.","5816":"Cell manipulation is imperative to the areas of cellular biology and tissue engineering, providing them a useful tool for patterning cells into cellular patterns for different analyses and applications. This paper presents a novel approach to perform three-dimensional (3D) cell manipulation and patterning with a multi-layer engineered scaffold. This scaffold structure employed dielectrophoresis as the non-contact mechanism to manipulate cells in the 3D domain. Through establishing electric fields via this multi-layer structure, the cells in the medium became polarized and were attracted towards the interior part of the structure, forming 3D cellular patterns. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the manipulation and the patterning processes with the proposed structure. Results show that with the presence of a voltage input, this multi-layer structure was capable of manipulating different types of biological cells examined through dielectrophoresis, enabling automatic cell patterning in the time-scale of minutes. The effects of the voltage input on the resultant cellular pattern were examined and discussed. Viability test was performed after the patterning operation and the results confirmed that majority of the cells remained viable. After 7 days of culture, 3D cellular patterns were observed through SEM. The results suggest that this scaffold and its automated dielectrophoresis-based patterning mechanism can be used to construct artificial tissues for various tissue engineering applications.","376":"Graphene oxide (GO)\/chitosan composite membrane with a thickness of several hundred nanometers was prepared through an interfacial self-assembly process. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to study the interactions that induced the assembly of GO nanosheets and chitosan and identified that the results showed that the major interactions were from electrostatic interactions. The surface morphology of synthesized membrane can be further tuned by adjusting the concentration of the chitosan solution. This new method is very effective to improve the GO\/chitosan composite membrane production and may promote its broad potential applications in battery industry and life sciences.","2829":"Herein, we report a simple strategy for the rational design of a three-dimensional carbon material, in situ nitrogen-doped porous multi-nano-channel carbon nanorods (N-MCNR), using immiscible polymers blends. A series of N-MCNR with discrete and well-connected continuous nano channels ranging from 18 to 75 nm in size was developed. The N-MCNR developed in this work represents the good controllability of nanopores and nanochannels integrated at the nanoscale level. Three-dimensional N-MCNR nanostructured materials have been recommended as a promising electrode material for use in high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). A prototypical pouch-type symmetric SC was assembled and operated under practical application conditions. The N-MCNR-based symmetric SC device fabricated in this study delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 335 F g(-1) at 0.25 A g(-1) with corresponding energy density of 11.2 Wh kg(-1), and also exhibited an outstanding long-term cycle stability of 50 000 cycles, with 92.6% charge retention.","755":"In this study, we prepared electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers functionalized with dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) crown ether and showed the potential of these fibers for the selective recovery of K+ from other both mono-and divalent ions in aqueous solutions. Nanofibers were characterized by SEM, FTIR and TGA. SEM results showed that the crown ether addition resulted in thicker nanofibers and higher mean fiber diameters, in a range of 138 to 270 nm. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the potential of the crown ether modified nanofibers as an adsorbent for ion removal. The maximum adsorption capacity of the crown ether modified nanofibers for K+ was 0.37 mmol g(-1) and the nanofibers followed the selectivity sequence of K+ > Ba2+ > Na+ similar to Li+ for single ion experiments. Adsorption of Ba2+ ions onto crown ether-modified nanofiber was examined by XPS and the results confirmed the adsorption of the ion. Mixed ion adsorption experiments revealed competitive adsorption between K+ and Ba2+ ions for the available binding sites. This effect was not observed for the other monovalent ions present in the solution and exceptionally high selectivities for K+ over Li+ and Na+ were obtained. Also the crown ether modified nanofibers exhibited good regeneration properties and a good reusability over multiple consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. Electrospinning is thus shown to be a very versatile tool to prepare crown ether functional polymer adsorbents for the selective recovery of ions.","291":"This article reviews the pulmonary route of administration, aerosol delivery devices, characterization of pulmonary drug delivery systems, and discusses the rationale for inhaled delivery of siRNA. Diseases with known protein malfunctions may be mitigated through the use of siRNA therapeutics. The inhalation route of administration provides local delivery of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of various pulmonary diseases, however barriers to pulmonary delivery and intracellular delivery of siRNA exists. siRNA loaded nanocarriers can be used to overcome the barriers associated with the pulmonary route, such as anatomical barriers, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar macrophage clearance. Apart from naked siRNA aerosol delivery, previously studied siRNA carrier systems comprise of lipidic, polymeric, peptide, or inorganic origin. Such siRNA delivery systems formulated as aerosols can be successfully delivered via an inhaler or nebulizer to the pulmonary region. Preclinical animal investigations of inhaled siRNA therapeutics rely on intratracheal and intranasal siRNA and siRNA nanocarrier delivery. Aerosolized siRNA delivery systems may be characterized using in vitro techniques, such as dissolution test, inertial cascade impaction, delivered dose uniformity assay, laser diffraction, and laser Doppler velocimetry. The ex vivo techniques used to characterize pulmonary administered formulations include the isolated perfused lung model. In vivo techniques like gamma scintigraphy, 3D SPECT, PET, MRI, luorescence imaging and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamics analysis may be used for evaluation of aerosolized siRNA delivery systems. The use of inhalable siRNA delivery systems encounters barriers to their delivery, however overcoming the barriers while formulating a safe and effective delivery system will offer unique advances to the field of inhaled medicine.","4387":"In spite of ample researches and admirable achievements, there are still a significant number of deaths happening every year due to cancer. Furthermore, the number of new cases recorded is also not reduced despite the advent of various preventive measures. Though current clinical approaches yield commendable results, they elicit severe systemic side-effects and also fail to avoid the recurrence of the disease. To address these issues, nanotechnology-empowered modern drug delivery systems showcase excellent properties for the targeting and controlled delivery of biomolecules over a period of time. In the past decade, the materials-based cancer research field has witnessed the exploration of several attractive drug delivery approaches for the administration of synthetic drugs to genetic materials. Among those, the electrospinning-based nanofibrous mesh has attracted several works on treating common deadly cancers such as those of the lung, breast and colon. The capability of nanofibers to enable increased drug loading, maintenance of significant bioactivity, excellent drug encapsulation, controlled and targeted delivery, has helped the researchers to achieve successful administration of a variety of anti-cancer agents. This review gives an insight into the process of electrospinning, its essential parameters, the types of drug incorporation and the works reported on common deadly cancers. Moreover, the future direction of this effective alternative is also delineated, making electrospun nanofibers as a suitable vehicle for delivering drugs to the cancer sites.","1606":"Exfoliated graphene oxide (EG)\/manganese(II) oxide (MnO) composite powder is synthesized by simple solid state graphenothermal reduction process. Structural, chemical, and morphological studies confirm the formation of EG\/MnO composite in which cubic MnO crystallites are found to anchor onto EG surfaces. The as-synthesized EG\/MnO composite is constituted with 65 and 35 wt % of MnO and EG, respectively. The EG\/MnO composite exhibits a specific surface area of similar to 82 m(2) g(-1) and an average pore size of similar to 12 nm. As an anode in lithium-ion batteries, the EG\/MnO composite shows a high reversible capacity of 936 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 75 nnA g(-1). Capacity retention of similar to 84% (784 mAh g(-1)) is observed even at the 100th cycle which corresponds to a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99%. Cyclic voltammetry studies on the composite show that Li storage is owing to reversible conversion reactions of MnO and electrochemical absorption\/desorption by EG. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies clearly show easy lithiation kinetics. Owing to the electrochemical performance of EG\/MnO composite and its easy, reproducible, and scalable synthesis procedure, it is an excellent addition to this class of similar materials.","188":"Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) is a physical technology that has been previously employed for surface treatment (cleaning, coating, erosion, etc.) and water or air depollution. We show here that, beyond surface effects, NTAP is capable of enabling the complete and fast polymerization of various mono-and disaccharides in the solid state within only a few minutes and at low temperature (40-80 degrees C). NTAP-induced polymerization involves a radical mechanism and yields water soluble polysaccharides with a mean molar mass of up to 100 000 g mol(-1) and a mean hydrodynamic radius of 3 nm. Although polymerization reactions promoted by NTAP occurs in a random manner, the alpha-1,6 and beta-1,6 linkages are however dominant. Furthermore, we discovered that NTAP is highly selective, strongly favoring glycosylation over other chemical transformations in the bulk. Under our working conditions, glycosyl units are preserved that constitute the repeating units of the polysaccharide product. No chemical degradation (e.g. intramolecular dehydration reactions) was observed, allowing a white powder to be recovered with a yield higher than 93 wt%. From a practical point of view, NTAP has great potential for breakthrough in the production of polysaccharides, notably because it does not require the use of a solvent or catalyst, thus by-passing the traditional post-treatment of aqueous effluents and catalyst recycling characteristic of biotechnological polysaccharide production. Its efficiency at low temperature also prevents carbohydrates from degradation. Finally, NTAP proceeds on an on\/off switch basis, allowing the polymerization reaction to be started and stopped quasi instantaneously.","5710":"A novel microporous N-doped carbon confined Se composite was developed as a cathode material for advanced Li-Se batteries. The microporous N-doped carbon was synthesized by carbonization of a ratio-fixed mixture of polypyrrole and KOH. The Se composite cathode is able to deliver a discharge capacity as high as 303 mA h g(-1) at 20 C and a reversible capacity of 506 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, even after 150 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the high electrical conductivity promoted by the N-doping and the unique microporous structure of carbonized polypyrrole, which creates additional active sites for Li-ion storage. More importantly, we used a first-principles calculation to evaluate the influence of heteroatom doping on the electrochemical performance, further confirming that the existence of heteroatoms in the carbon framework greatly facilitates the interaction between carbon and Li2Se, which could well explain the excellent cycling performance and rate capability.","1201":"Open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) with a new stationary phase, O-cynaoethyl chitosan, has been applied to the separation of four cephalosporins. Several experimental parameters such as the buffer type, pH and buffer concentration, mobile phase composition, and applied voltage were evaluated. Baseline resolution of the studied cephalosporins could be achieved within 14 min. The calibration curves of cefixime, cephalothin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone were linear over the concentration range of 0.6-50, 0.8-50, 0.8-50, and 1.0-50 mu g\/mL, respectively. The detection limits (S\/N = 3) of four cephalosporins ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 mu g\/mL and the recoveries of the milk samples were about 82.0-96.7% (RSD <= 3.8%).","4454":"Carbon nanospheres were synthesized using a reduction-pyrolysis-catalysis process with the reaction of carbon tetrachloride and aluminum at low temperature (160 degrees C), which is much lower than that of traditional methods.

In the present study, tara seed oil was obtained by ultrasonic extraction. The effects of different solvents, particle sizes in the ground seed samples, extraction times, ultrasonication powers, extraction temperatures, and liquid-solid ratios on the yield of tara seed oil were investigated. The yield from the ultrasonic extraction was compared with that from traditional Soxhlet extraction. The results showed that ultrasonic extraction could be completed in a shorter time with reduced solvent consumption. The yield of tara seed oil increased with increasing ultrasonication power and extraction temperature. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the fatty acid compositions of the oils extracted by the two methods. The fatty acid compositions of the oils from both extraction methods were similar, which indicates that ultrasonic extraction is a viable alternative means of extraction. It is a rapid, efficient, and simple method for production of lipids from tara seeds.","4295":"Chitosan-stabilised copper-iron oxide nanocomposite material is found to be a very efficient recyclable\/reusable heterogeneous catalyst for azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The as-synthesized nanocomposite material is magnetically recoverable and reusable for a minimum of four cycles without significant loss in its catalytic activity.

However, most reports on rGO hydrogels focused on their applications, while the formation mechanism has not been paid enough attention. For the first time, we demonstrated the higher the ability of the solvents to form hydrogen bonds with the rGO sheets, the better the structural stability and properties of gel are. This study indicates that hydrogen bonding between solvent molecules and the oxygen-containing functional groups on rGO sheets is vital to achieve high-performance gels.","5242":"Novel polyamide thin film composite (TFC) nanofiltration (NF) membranes were prepared on polyetherimide supports by the interfacial polymerization of 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarbonyl chloride and m-phenylenediamine followed by modification with ethylenediamine (EDA). The TFC NF membranes thus prepared were characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); these results indicated that by covalent bonding with EDA, the unstable carboxylic groups on the initially generated poly(amic acid) (PAA) TFC membrane surfaces were effectively transformed into polyamide, including the methylene group in the chemical structure chain, for preparing the PAA-cov-EDA NF membranes. At an operating pressure of 1.0 MPa, the PAA-cov-EDA NF membrane exhibits a glucose rejection of 90% at a flux of 25 L m(-2) h(-1), and a MgSO4 rejection of 76% at a flux of 31 L m(-2) h(-1), in particular demonstrating its superior chlorine resistance, after being immersed in a 200 ppm NaClO solution for 100 h. Such novel polyamide TFC NF membranes have the advantages of mild preparation conditions and high rejection towards low-molecular-weight organics, thus demonstrating their potential in the pharmaceutical industry.","2726":"Lithium-sulfur batteries have been investigated as promising electrochemical-energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density. Sulfur-based cathodes must not only be highly conductive to enhance the utilization of sulfur, but also effectively confine polysulfides to mitigate their dissolution. A new physical and chemical entrapment strategy is based on a highly efficient sulfur host, namely hollow carbon nanofibers (HCFs) filled with MnO2 nanosheets. Benefiting from both the HCFs and birnessite-type MnO2 nanosheets, the MnO2@HCF hybrid host not only facilitates electron and ion transfer during the redox reactions, but also efficiently prevents polysulfide dissolution. With a high sulfur content of 71wt% in the composite and an areal sulfur mass loading of 3.5mgcm(-2) in the electrode, the MnO2@HCF\/S electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1161mAhg(-1) (4.1mAhcm(-2)) at 0.05C and maintained a stable cycling performance at 0.5C over 300cycles.","6214":"Nucleic acids are an attractive platform for organizing molecular self-assembly because of their specific nucleobase interactions and defined length scale. Routinely employed in the organization and assembly of materials in vitro, however, they have rarely been exploited in vivo, due to the concerns for enzymatic degradation and cross-hybridization with the host's genetic materials. Herein we report the development of a tight-binding, orthogonal, synthetically versatile, and informationally interfaced nucleic acid platform for programming molecular interactions, with implications for in vivo molecular assembly and computing. The system consists of three molecular entities: the right-handed and left-handed conformers and a nonhelical domain. The first two are orthogonal to each other in recognition, while the third is capable of binding to both, providing a means for interfacing the two conformers as well as the natural nucleic acid biopolymers (i.e., DNA and RNA). The three molecular entities are prepared from the same monomeric chemical scaffold, with the exception of the stereochemistry or lack thereof at the gamma-backbone that determines if the corresponding oligo adopts a right-handed or left-handed helix, or a nonhelical motif. These conformers hybridize to affinity, sequence selectivity, and level of orthogonality. Recognition modules as short as five nucleotides in length are capable of organizing molecular assembly.","7209":"In this letter, we report a novel V-doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst synthesized via electrospinning followed by a thermal diffusion process at low temperature. The morphological and crystalline structural investigations reveal not only that the V-doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst possesses a uniform, porous, fibrous structure, but also that some V5+ ions are introduced into the SrTiO3 lattice. The photocatalytic capability of V-doped SrTiO3 porous nanofibers was evaluated through photodegrading methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution under artificial UV-vis light. The results indicated that V-doped SrTiO3 porous nanofibers have excellent catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the excellent catalytic activity was maintained even after five cycle tests, indicating that they have outstanding photocatalytic endurance. It is suggested that the excellent photocatalytic performance of doped SrTiO3 nanofibers is possibly attributed to the V5+ ion doping increasing the light utilization as well as to the outstanding porous features, the excellent component and structure stability.","4371":"An anode catalytic layer for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) with decreased PtRu loading as low as 1.0 mg cm(-2) has been prepared by an electrospray method. The morphology of the electrosprayed composite of PtRu\/C\/Nafion\/polyethylene oxide (PEO) is altered from irregular particles to porous microspheres and to nanofibers by adjusting the PEO content. A hybrid structure is assembled using the porous microspheres as the anode catalytic layer for DMFCs, leading to a remarkable enhancement in the maximum power density of 35.4 mW cm(-2), which is similar to 50% higher than that of the conventional one at the same PtRu loading of 1.0 mg cm(-2) and is even comparable to that (31.5 mW cm(-2)) of the conventional one at a higher PtRu loading of 2.0 mg cm(-2). Further investigation reveals that the improved performance is mainly attributed to its hierarchical factual structure. In the primary structure, a single microsphere is with well-distributed PtRu\/C and is fully rich in nano-pores and nano-channels, resulting in an increase in the electrochemical active surface area and higher catalyst utilization. In the secondary structure, micro-sized pathways are formed by the stereoscopic microspheres, resulting in enhanced mass transport, higher current density and power density.","6092":"Today, we face some significant environmental and energy problems such as global warming, urban heat island, and the precarious balance of world oil supply and demand. However, we have not yet found a satisfactory solution to these problems. Wasteheat recovery is considered to be one of the best solutions because it can improve energy efficiency by converting heat exhausted from plants and machinery to electric power. This technology would also prevent atmospheric temperature increases caused by waste heat, and decrease fossil fuel consumption by recovering heat energy, thus also reducing CO2 emissions. The system proposed in this research generates electric power by providing waste heat or unharnessed thermal energy to built-in thermoelectric modules that can convert heat into electric power. Waste heat can be recovered from many places, including machinery in industrial plants, piping in electric power plants, waste incineration plants, and so on. Some natural heat sources such as hot springs and solar heat can also be used for this thermoelectric generation system. The generated power is expected to be supplied to auxiliary machinery around the heat source, stored as an emergency power supply, and so on. The attributes of this system are (1) direct power generation using hot springs or waste heat; (2) 24-h stable power generation; (3) stand-alone power system with no noise and no vibration; and (4) easy maintenance attributed to its simple structure with no moving parts. In order to maximize energy use efficiency, the temperature difference between both sides of the thermoelectric (TE) modules built into the system need to be kept as large as possible. This means it is important to reduce thermal resistance between TE modules and heat source. Moreover, the system's efficiency greatly depends on the base temperature of the heat sources and the material of the system's TE modules. Therefore, in order to make this system practical and efficient, it is necessary to choose the heat source first and then design the most appropriate structure for the source by applying analytical methods. This report describes how to design a prototype of a thermoelectric power generator using the analytical approach and the results of performance evaluation tests carried out in the field.","6940":"Cu-0 nanoparticles (NPs)-doped TiO2 nanofibers (NFs) were prepared as an effective photodegradation of three azo dyes as well as an antimicrobial agent under visible light.

This composite material represents a prospective new class of novel catalysts wherein the improved light absorption behavior of a metal doped coupled oxide, Ag-Bi2O3-ZnO is anticipated to enhance with the observed benefits of a coupled system of Bi2O3-ZnO. Characterization of Ag-Bi2O3-ZnO revealed interesting optical and morphological characteristics. XRD patterns indicated that well-crystallized alpha-Bi2O3 was formed on the hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO along with Ag in the process. The HR-SEM images revealed the formation of organized intercrossed sheets and peanut shell like structure, which were composed of nanosheets and nanoparticles respectively. Elemental color mapping confirms the homogeneity of Zn, O, Ag and Bi in the catalyst. Ag-Bi2O3-ZnO has enhanced absorption in the UV and visible region when compared to Bi2O3 and ZnO. This catalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Acid Red 1 (AR 1), Evens Blue (EB) and Acid Violet 7 ( AV 7) under natural sunlight far exceeding those of the Bi2O3, Ag-ZnO, Ag-Bi2O3 and ZnO systems at neutral pH. Ag-Bi2O3-ZnO was found to be stable and reusable without appreciable loss of photocatalytic activity for up to five runs. Ag-Bi2O3-ZnO shows enhanced electrochemical methanol oxidation when compared to Ag-Bi2O3, Bi2O3-ZnO, Ag-ZnO and ZnO.

Thermal processing of the X-ray amorphous, as-synthesized VFe2Ox aerogels at 300 degrees C under O-2-rich conditions removes residual organic byproducts while maintaining a highly defective gamma-Fe2O3-like local structure with minimal long-range order and vanadium in the +5 state. When as-synthesized VFe2Ox aerogels are heated under low partial pressure of O-2 (e.g., flowing argon), a fraction of vanadium sites are reduced to the +4 state, driving crystallization to a Fe3O4-like cubic phase. Subsequent thermal oxidation of this nanocrystalline VFe2Ox aerogel re-oxidizes vanadium +4 to +5, creating additional cation vacancies and re-introducing disordered oxide domains. We correlate the electrochemical charge-storage properties of this series of VFe2Ox aerogels with their degree of order and chemical state, as verified by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We find that the disordered O-2-heated VFe2Ox aerogel yields the highest Li+- and Na+-insertion capacities among this series, approaching 130 mA h g(-1) and 70 mA h g(-1), respectively. Direct heat-treatment of the VFe2Ox aerogel in flowing argon to yield the partially reduced, nanocrystalline form results in significantly lower Li+-insertion capacity (77 mA h g(-1)), which improves to 105 mA h g(-1) by thermal oxidation to create additional vacancies and structural disorder.","1545":"Active carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with porous structure show highly electrochemical double-layer capacitance for supercapacitors because of their large specific area. However, their poor crystallization induced the low conductivity, which could largely limit the electrochemical performance of the porous CNFs. In this research, porous CNFs with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were prepared by electrospinning and high temperature carbonization. The introduction of SWCNTs into porous CNFs could largely enhance the conductivity of the porous CNF nanotextiles, thus the electrochemical performance of the composite nanotextile was largely enhanced. The specific capacitance of the composite could achieve 417 F\/g at a current density of 0.5 A\/g, and keep 193 F\/g at the high current density of 10 A\/g. Furthermore its specific capacitance could keep 96% after 2000 cycles of charge\/discharge at the current density of 10 A\/g. This nanotextile could be a promising candidate for the binder-free and filler-free electrodes of high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is sensitive to several medium parameters, such as temperature, pH and ionic strength, is electroactive and conductive and can be easily attached to gold surfaces. All these properties were cumulated in one microcomposite by combining three components: poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) crosslinked with N, N'-bisacryloylcystine (p(NIPA-BISS) microgel), polyaniline nanofibers and gold nanoparticles. The presence of the polyaniline nanofibers and gold nanoparticles in the composite particles led to a substantial increase in conductivity and electroactivity. Additionally, the transition from the swollen to the collapsed state further enhanced the electroactivity and conductivity of the microcomposite.

SLNs were mainly composed of three different biocompatible and biodegradable matrix lipids called tripalmitin, glyceryl dibehenate, and triglyceride, all containing the cationic lipid N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propy1)-N, N, N-trimethylammonium (DOTAP (R)). Each of these SLNs were divided into three parts and characterized by applying different processes: Part I was autoclaved (121 degrees C, 15 min), Part II was lyophilized (5 mbar, 50 degrees C), and Part III was kept in its intact form. These parts were stored at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C (room temp.), and 40 degrees C for short-term stability tests. The formulations were tested physically regarding the particle size and zeta potential. pUC18 plasmid DNA was used as the genetic material. Zeta potentials of all SLNs and pDNA-SLN complexes were determined to be highly positive (between +28.90 and +59.39). Crystallization processes of lipid matrices were characterized by X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry. pDNA binding ability of SLNs and the stability of pDNA-SLN complexes with DNase I enzyme were also determined by gel electrophoresis. It was determined that all formulations became positively charged with DOTAP (R). They were able to bind DNA and were partially protective against enzyme degradation.

They offer great potential for membrane protein nanotechnologies. We report here a charge-interaction-directed reconstitution mechanism that induces spontaneous insertion of bovine rhodopsin, the eukaryotic GPCR, into both lipid-and polymer-based artificial membranes. We reveal a new allosteric mode of rhodopsin activation incurred by the non-biological membranes: the cationic membrane drives a transition from the inactive MI to the activated MII state in the absence of high [H+] or negative spontaneous curvature. We attribute this activation to the attractive charge interaction between the membrane surface and the deprotonated Glu134 residue of the rhodopsin-conserved ERY sequence motif that helps break the cytoplasmic \"ionic lock\".

The specific absorption rate varied from 215 Wig for chitosan-free MNPs to about 190 Wig for chitosan-coated ones, and an equilibrium temperature of 46 degrees C was reached when chitosan-coated MNPs were subjected to AMF. The chitosan-free Fe68.2Cr11.5Nb0.3B20 MNPs proved a good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity in all testing conditions, while the chitosan-coated ones induced strong tumoricidal effects when a cell-particle simultaneous co-incubation approach was used.

The nitrate solution was soaked into cellulose and then was heated to a phase formation temperature of 880 degrees C with a dwell of 6 and 24 hours followed by oxygenation for 100 hours at 460 degrees C. Fine particles of YBCO, sintered together to form long (> 100 mu m) thread like structure with a diameter of similar to 2 mu m were observed.

Here, we report a novel hierarchical pore architecture material composed of a micro-sized porous carbon sphere matrix embedded with hollow nanocapsules (HNs-HPCS) as a promising anode material for large capacity and ultra-high rate capability in LIBs. Such a hierarchical porous structure delivers a very high capacity of 805 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), and the capacity of ca. 210 mA h g(-1) can be kept at 20 A g(-1) (ca. 38 s to fully charge). We believe that the hollow nanocapsules embedded within the carbon interior would store large amounts of Li ions, while hierarchical pores are favorable for the fast transportation of Li ions in the electrolyte to a great degree, and thus mean that the micro-sized material has great potential for the fabrication of high-performance LIBs.","216":"The growth of Au nanomembranes is realized using an anisotropic hexadecylglyceryl maleate (HGM) hydrogel with a one-dimensional periodic lamellar structure. Compared with other systems, the growth of Au in the HGM hydrogel is slower, such that the formation process of such 2D films can be observed clearly. The produced Au nanomembranes possess atomically smooth surfaces and exhibit excellent optical and electrical properties.","4301":"Now-a-days, researchers have paid much attention towards photodecomposition of water into H-2 and O-2 for the development of a green and sustainable environment.

In this article, we have reviewed and summarized some of the visible light responsive metal oxide photocatalysts developed by various research groups including our group. The different techniques adopted for the development of effective visible light responsive photocatalysts are explored and explained with examples. This review article highlights the ongoing challenges and opportunities in the field of photocatalytic water splitting.

Recently, magnetic technology has been applied in pollution removal. Over the past few years, magnetic adsorption technology has attracted considerable attention for use in dye and metal removal. Magnetic nanoparticles are particularly attractive because of their inherent properties such as large surface area and fast response under applied external magnetic field. The high surface area to volume ratio and super-paramagnetism of magnetic nanoparticles, combined with formation of complexes between adsorbent and beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CD), can effectively remove pollutants from wastewater. These nanoparticles modified with cyclodextrins also can be used in chiral separations. Therefore nowadays, efforts are being made to magnetic nanoparticle modified with CDs as efficient adsorbent in separations.","421":"Background: With the increasing demand for large scale energy storage, people pay more and more attention on the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its low cost and abundance resource. This paper provides a new kind of anode material with satisfied electrical performance for SIBs. Methods: Fe2O3-carbon composite nanofibers (FeCNFs) were synthesized through an uncomplicated and meliorable electrospinning process followed by calcination. The obtained FeCNFs were applied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Results: The FeCNFs SIBs show excellent performance. At a current density of 50 mA g(-1), a high reversible capacity of 606 mA h g(-1) is achieved. Moreover, an ideal reversible capacity of 167 mAh g(-1) is achieved even at a current density of 500 mA g(-1), demonstrating good rate capability of FeCNFs. Conclusion: As compared with pure carbon nanofibers (CNFs), the capacity and rate capability of FeCNFs are drastically improved due to the homogeneous dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanofibers. Such a structure prevents the aggregation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, maintains the structure integrity and thus enhances the electrochemical performance.","505":"A novel sorbent of pectin\/Al2O3-ZrO2 core\/shell beads for fluoride removal was prepared via a coaxial electrostatic spinning device, and its fluoride removal performance was investigated in batch experiments. The properties of the sorbent and the mechanism of fluoride removal were characterized by SEM, EDX and XPS. The effect on the sorption performance of various factors of initial pH, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, and sorption temperature were examined by batch experiments. The experimental data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich model, and the maximum sorption capacity was calculated to be 98.077 mg g(-1). Meanwhile, the results showed that the sorption kinetic data was well fitted to pseudo-second-order. The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0) calculated according to the study showed that the process of fluoride removal was spontaneous and exothermic. The pectin\/Al2O3-ZrO2 core\/shell bead sorbent could be considered as an effective sorbent for fluoride removal compared with other sorbents.","6815":"The nature of a particle surface has a tremendous influence on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of the particle, in addition to the particle size. In this study, multilayer modified albumin nanoparticles were developed to encapsulate teniposide, an anti-cancer agent used in the treatment of lung cancer, in order to optimize its distribution and pharmacokinetics. Multilayer nanoparticles were prepared by coating albumin particles with chitosan and subsequently with PLG-PEG. The multilayer structure was confirmed by the increase in particle size, reverse potential, surface components and morphology, suggesting a layer by layer coating mechanism, involving electrostatic interaction. According to the results of the in vitro release and cytotoxicity studies, the multilayer particles were slightly pH-sensitive to an acidic environment. More importantly, compared with the commercial injection, the modified particles showed a preference for distribution in the lung and exhibited far lower concentrations in the heart and kidney and a prolonged circulation in plasma after intravenous injection, whereas the naked albumin nanoparticles mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen. In addition, P-CS-NP with a reduced amount of PLG-PEG transiently and extensively accumulated in the lung but then rapidly migrated to the liver or spleen, suggesting that the amount of coated layer on the particles affected the targeting behavior and retention in the lung. Therefore, the structure of the albumin core and multi-coated layers are a very promising way for achieving controlled release and passively targeted delivery to the lung.","1694":"A practical and green approach for the one-pot multicomponent synthesis of tetraheterocyclic benzimidazolo[2,3-b]quinazolinones has been described via the condensation of 2-aminobenzimidazole or 2-aminobenzothiazole, dimedone, and various aldehydes using Fe3O4@chitosan as an environmentally benign and reusable nanocomposite catalyst in good to excellent yields.","5924":"The production of hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting is a potentially clean and renewable source for hydrogen fuel. Cadmium chalcogenides are attractive photocatalysts because they have the potential to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using photons in the visible spectrum. Cadmium sulfide rods with embedded cadmium selenide quantum dots (CdSe@CdS) are particularly attractive because of their high molar absorptivity in the UV-blue spectral region, and their energy bands can be tuned; however, two crucial drawbacks hinder the implementation of these materials in wide spread use: poor charge transfer and photochemical instability. Utilizing photochemical deposition of co-catalysts onto CdSe@CdS substrates we can address each of these weaknesses. We report how novel co-catalyst morphologies can greatly increase efficiency for the water reduction half-reaction. We also report photostability for CdSe@CdS under high intensity 455nm light (a wavelength at which photocatalytic water splitting by CdSe@CdS is possible) by growing metal oxide co-catalysts on the surface of our rods.","7189":"Interconnected carbon nanofibers networks (ICNNs) prepared through the carbonization of polypyrrole (PPy) precursor are utilized as conductive pathways and buffer to improve the Na storage performance of antimony (Sb) as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

The reversible capacity can remain 542.5 mAh g(-1), with a high capacity retention of 96.7% after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). And the superior rate performance is also observed, the reversible capacity can still reach 325 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 3200 mA g(-1).

However, the functionalization of hydrogel constructs with curcumin has been challenging due to its low water solubility. Here, we developed the preparation of alginate\/methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hybrid hydrogels functionalized with nanoliposomes encapsulating curcumin. Physicochemical properties of the polymer solutions and resulting hydrogels were studied. The engineered systems showed great rheological and swelling properties. The release behavior of curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes demonstrated their suitability as a drug delivery system.

Hence, MBGs have been used in drug delivery and bone tissue engineering. MBGs can be developed as either a dense or porous block. Compared with a block, microbeads provide greater flexibility for filling different-shaped cavities and are suitable for culturing cells in vitro. In contrast, the fibrous structure of a scaffold has been shown to increase cell attachment and differentiation due to its ability to mimic the three-dimensional structure of natural extracellular matrices. Hence, the aim of this study is to fabricate MBG microbeads with a fibrous structure. First, a sol-gel\/electrospinning technique was utilized to fabricate the MBG nanofiber (MBGNF) structure. Subsequently, the MBGNF microbeads (MFBs) were produced by an electrospraying technology. The results show that the diameter of the MFBs decreases when the applied voltage increases. The drug loading and release profiles and mechanisms of the MFBs were also evaluated. MFBs had a better drug entrapment efficiency, could reduce the burst release of tetracycline, and sustain the release over 10 days. Hence, the MFBs may be suitable drug carriers. In addition, the cellular attachment of MG63 osteoblast-like cells is significantly higher for MFBs than for glass microbeads after culturing for 4 h. The nanofibrous structure of MFBs could provide an appropriate environment for cellular spreading. Therefore, MFBs have great potential for use as a bone graft material in bone tissue engineering applications.","3931":"Graphene oxide (GO)-based composite nanostructures and nanomaterials with self-assembly structures and novel functions have received considerable interests. In this work, organogels with various nanostructures via functional cationic gemini amphiphilic compound-GO nanocomposites were designed and prepared. The gel formation properties of gemini-GO nanoconnposites in different used organic solvents can be adjustable by controlling the symmetry in molecular skeletons of amphiphiles. Longer substituent alkyl chains and symmetric structures in molecular skeletons helped to increase hydrophobic force and flexibility in self-assembly process.

A Tb Cholate hydrogel doped with specially designed, specific enzyme substrates (\"pro\"-sensitizers) was integrated on filter paper discs. The addition of small volumes(similar to 5 mu L) of enzyme solutions on these discs led to enhanced green emission (UV lamp, lambda(ex) 365 nm), allowing qualitative detection of the enzymes-when needed, the intensity enhancement can be quantified using image processing software, or for multiple samples using a commercial plate reader. This simple technique allowed the detection of beta-glucosidase in almond extract and lipase in blood serum. Easy identification of the inhibition of beta-glucosidase was also demonstrated. The paper based sensor is inexpensive, user-friendly and needs low volumes of biological sample for analysis. This strategy has the potential to be useful for possible clinical applications.","5671":"Si thin-film solar cells are suitable to the sunbelt region due to a low temperature coefficient and to building integrated photovoltaics owing to flexible size, easily controllable transmittance, and an aesthetic design. Nevertheless, the application is limited until now due to their low conversion efficiency. We have developed a triple junction cell (a-Si:H\/a-SiGe:H\/mu c-Si:H) providing efficient light utilization. For the high efficiency, we have focused on the smoothing of high haze TCO, a low absorption window layer, a low refractive index interlayer, uniformity control of the thickness and crystalline volume fraction in the microcrystalline silicon layer, and a low absorption back reflector. Through these activities, we have achieved a world record of 13.4% stabilized efficiency in the small size cell (1cm(2)) and 10.5% stabilized efficiency in the large area module (1.1x1.3m(2)), certificated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, respectively. This result was presented in solar cell efficiency tables (Version 41). At this moment, we have increased a stabilized efficiency of 11.2% (Output power 160W) in the large area module.

The WT pHLIP inserts into membranes with a pH(50) of 6.1, while most solid tumors have extracellular pH (pH(e)) of 6.5-7.0. To close this gap, a SAR study was carried out to search for pHLIP variants with improved pH response. Replacing Asp25 with a-aminoadipic acid (Aad) adjusts the pH(50) to 6.74, matching average tumor acidity, and replacing Asp14 with gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) increases the sharpness of pH response (transition over 0.5 instead of 1 pH unit). These effects are additive: the Asp14Gla\/Asp25Aad double variant shows a pH(50) of 6.79, with sharper transition than Asp25Aad. Furthermore, the advantage of the double variant over WT pHLIP in terms of cargo delivery was demonstrated in turn-on fluorescence assays and anti-proliferation studies (using paclitaxel as cargo) in A549 lung cancer cells at pH 6.6.","5982":"Accurate determination of intermolecular interaction forces at the surface and the interface is essential to identify the nature of interfacial phenomena such as absorption, interfacial assembly, and specific ion effect, but it still represents a major technical challenge. In this study, we proposed a novel method to deduce the interfacial interaction forces by using surface-sensitive second-order Fermi resonant signals, generated in sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS). By investigating the influence of lipid chain length and intermolecular distance on the Fermi resonant signals of phospholipid monolayer at the air\/CaF2 surface and the air\/water interface, a linear correlation between the Fermi resonant intensity ratio and the dominated interactions in the lipid monolayer has been observed. It implies that the amplitude of the intensity ratio can be used as an effective in situ vibrational optical ruler to characterize the total intermolecular interaction forces at the surface and the interface. Such a relationship further enables us to elucidate the specific ion effects on the interfacial interactions, contributions from van der Waals, electrostatic, and hydration interactions. This study clearly second-order Fermi resonant signals for evaluating the interfacial interaction forces in situ and allowing us to identify different demonstrates the power of the in real time.","1536":"BACKGROUNDThe effluent from pulp and paper mills is difficult to treat effectively via conventional biochemical processes due to the high concentration of lignin and its derivatives. In this study, the integration of electrochemical oxidation and biodegradation (EO-BD) for Kraft lignin (KL) was proposed to potentially enhance the efficiency of the treatment. Typical anodes, titanium based antimony doped tin dioxide electrodes (Ti\/Sb-SnO2), were used in the pre-degradation of KL solution (1000 mg L-1), followed by post-biodegradation using aerobic flora as inocula. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the EO-BD of KL. RESULTSThe optimum conditions obtained via RSM were: current density 3.68 mA cm(-2), electric quantity 14.49 kC and pH 9.0. Under these conditions, the maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and minimum specific energy consumption were predicted by the correlation developed to be 70.83% and 28.84 kWh kg(-1) COD, respectively, which agreed well with the experimental data. The results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that KL was partially degraded by EO, which was beneficial to the subsequent biodegradation. CONCLUSIONThis study validated the technical feasibility of adopting the EO-BD process to enhance KL degradation.

These effects were accompanied by concentration-dependent decreases in the expression levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins. Additionally, the AKR-E inhibitedthe expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 (22.7%) and IL-1 beta (74%).

However, ANs degenerate in deafness; the preservation of a robust AN target population, in combination with advances in cochlear implant technology, may provide improved hearing outcomes for cochlear implant patients. The exogenous delivery of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 is well known to support AN survival in deafness, and cell-based therapies provide a potential clinically viable option for delivering neurotrophins into the deaf cochlea. This study utilized cells that were genetically modified to express BDNF and encapsulated in alginate microspheres, and investigated AN survival in the deaf guinea pig following (a) cell-based neurotrophin treatment in conjunction with chronic electrical stimulation from a cochlear implant, and (b) long-term cell-based neurotrophin delivery. In comparison to deafened controls, there was significantly greater AN survival following the cell-based neurotrophin treatment, and there were ongoing survival effects for at least six months. In addition, functional benefits were observed following cell-based neurotrophin treatment and chronic electrical stimulation, with a statistically significant decrease in electrically evoked auditory brainstem response thresholds observed during the experimental period. This study demonstrates that cell-based therapies, in conjunction with a cochlear implant, shows potential as a clinically transferable means of providing neurotrophin treatment to support AN survival in deafness. This technology also has the potential to deliver other therapeutic agents, and to be used in conjunction with other biomedical devices for the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.

It was achieved by calcination\/carbonization of the as-deposited SnO2-gel\/cellulose hybrid in an argon atmosphere. As being employed as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the porous structures, small SnO2 crystallite sizes, and the carbon buffering matrix possessed by the nanocomposite facilitate the electrode-electrolyte contact, promote the electron transfer and Li+ diffusion, and relieve the severe volume change and aggregation of the active particles during the charge\/discharge cycles. Hence, the nanocomposite showed high reversible capacity, significant cycling stability, and rate capability that are superior to the nanotubular SnO2 and SnO2 sol-gel powder counter materials. For such a composite with 27.8wt% SnO2 content and 346.4m(2)g(-1) specific surface area, a capacity of 623mAhg(-1) was delivered after 120 cycles at 0.2C.

A morphological phase diagram of R6C6 DBCs with respect to the properties and diameter of pores is presented. In nonselective and weak rod-selective pores, stacked disks, single helix, and double helix are assembled. While in strong rod-selective nanopores, coil blocks assemble into stacked disks, cylinder, and then zigzag structure in the interior region of pore with the increase in the pore diameter. The zigzag structure evolves into curb chain-like structure, corrugated pipe and single helix tube with further increase in the pore diameter. The zigzag structure is induced by the movement of rod blocks toward the pore surface and subsequent assembly near the surface. In these interesting structures, rod blocks align parallel to the pore axis and the axial component of the mean square end-to-end distance of rod blocks is generally bigger than that in the bulk. At last, a morphological phase diagram in terms of the block length and the pore diameter is obtained. Our simulation results demonstrate that the synergetic interaction among the rigidity of the rod block, the incommensurability of the pore diameter, and the preference of the pore surface for the rod block, plays an important role in the assembly of RC DBCs.","5774":"In present work, influences of molar fraction and acyl chain length of lipids on the interaction between cationic nanoparticles (NP) and the lipid bilayer have been investigated via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the participation of the anionic lipids improves the NP-membrane interaction; however in the case of PC\/PG mixed membrane, the bending of the membrane is merely dependent on the increase of molar fraction of charged lipids in the heterogeneous membrane because of the relatively slow diffusion of lipids in the membrane and the repulsive effect between charged lipids against their further aggregation around the NP. Besides, it is also found that the acyl chain length of lipids plays a crucial role on the NP-induced structural variation and morphology transition of the lipid bilayer. As a charged NP attaches to the membrane, a thin DPPC\/POPG membrane is more vulnerable to these extracellular disturbances than a relatively thick DSPC\/DOPG membrane. Different from the NP-induced lipid eyelid structure budding from the DSPC\/DOPG membrane, the adsorption of a NP disrupts the DPPC\/POPG membrane and evokes a water pore in the lipid bilayer, implying the translocation mechanism of a NP across the membrane could be mediated by the acyl chain length of lipids. These results are beneficial for an further understanding in the translocation mechanism of nanocarriers as drug delivery vehicles for cancer therapeutics.","7020":"Films of submicrometric hollow capsules of a metal oxide material have attracted great attention in the field of the inorganic meso-foams.

Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4358). It forms an Fe-based polyanionic compound delivering the highest Fe-redox potential along with excellent rate kinetics and reversibility. However, like all known SO4-based insertion materials, its synthesis is cumbersome that warrants careful processing avoiding any aqueous exposure. Here, an alternate low temperature ionothermal synthesis has been described to produce the alluaudite Na2+2xFe2-xII(SO4)(3). It marks the first demonstration of solvothermal synthesis of alluaudite Na2+2xM2-xII(SO4)(3) (M = 3d metals) family of cathodes. Unlike classical solid-state route, this solvothermal route favors sustainable synthesis of homogeneous nanostructured alluaudite products at only 300 degrees C, the lowest temperature value until date. The current work reports the synthetic aspects of pristine and modified ionothermal synthesis of Na2+2xFe2-xII(SO4)(3) having tunable size (300 nm similar to 5 mu m) and morphology. It shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 12 K. A reversible capacity in excess of 80 mAh\/g was obtained with good rate kinetics and cycling stability over 50 cycles. Using a synergistic approach combining experimental and ab initio DFT analysis, the structural, magnetic, electronic, and electrochemical properties and the structural limitation to extract full capacity have been described.","6763":"A new method of solid\/liquid interfacial polymerization of aniline in non-aqueous solutions reproducibly provides polyanilines with a higher molecular weight, lower degree of ortho-substitution, and higher degree of crystallinity, exhibiting higher electrical conductivity than the conventional aqueous method.","746":"Paenibacillus spp. BD3526, a bacterium exhibiting a protein hydrolysis circle surrounded with an obvious precipitation zone on skim milk agar, was isolated from raw yak (Bos grunniens) milk collected in Tibet, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and whole genome sequence comparison indicated the isolate belong to the genus Paenibacillus. The strain BD3526 demonstrated strong ability to produce protease with milk clotting activity (MCA) in wheat bran broth. The protease with MCA was predominantly accumulated during the late-exponential phase of growth. The proteolytic activity (PA) of the BD3526 protease was 1.33-fold higher than that of the commercial R. miehei coagulant. A maximum MCA (6470 +\/- 281 SU mL(-1)) of the strain BD3526 was reached under optimal cultivation conditions. The protease with MCA was precipitated from the cultivated supernatant of wheat bran broth with ammonium sulfate and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of the protease with MCA was determined as 35 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gelatin zymography. The cleavage site of the BD3526 protease with MCA in -casein was located at the Met(106)-Ala(107) bond, as determined by mass spectrometry analysis.","2669":"We report for the first time on the combination of polymer replication method and flock technology to produce 4555 bioactive glass (4555 BG) scaffolds with a fibrous surface morphology suitable for tissue engineering (TE). In order to develop a fibrous morphology on the surface of the scaffolds, electroflocking was used with BG scaffolds serving as the substrate. Gelatin was used as the adhesive and short polyamide (PA) fibers were electroflocked on the top surface to produce scaffolds with anisotropic properties. In order to improve the stability of the adhesive (gelatin) and to create a better bonding between the fibers and the adhesive, a crosslinking step was carried out. The porosity on the surface could be tailored by varying the flocking time which, in turn, was shown to influence the packing density of the fibers. In vitro bioactivity study in simulated body fluid (SBF) was carried out and complete mineralization of the scaffold, including on the PA fibers, was detected and characterized using various techniques.

For the preparation of nanohybrids, two approaches were designed: in the first one, after chlorination of GO with thionyl chloride, GO was reacted with propargyl alcohol and subsequently clicked with azide-glucoside. The resulted sweet GNS were easily dispersed in water and stable for 2 weeks. In the second approach, GO was functionalized with 3,4,5-tris(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzoic acid via hydroxyl groups on its basal plane and finally treated with azide-glucoside. The obtained hydrophilic GNS were stable in water for 3 weeks. The results showed that both glucose-grafted GO sheets were reduced by sodium ascorbate during click-coupling reaction; this is one of the many advantages of click reaction. Finally, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were deposited on the sweet GNS and were superparamagnetic, responded quickly to an external magnetic field and exhibited efficient adsorption towards methylene blue, as a cationic dye. No leaching was observed even after a week of placing a magnet close to the vial containing the dispersion of magnetic sweet GNS.","3907":"In this study, a three-dimensional magnetic field assisted electrospinning (MFAES) system has been modeled to understand the correlation between the applied magnetic field and electric field distributions during nanoparticle alignment. The results reveal that the electric field distribution has been altered by positioning the magnets at the needle end. The analysis explored the possibility to create a stable liquid jet under a magnetic field, which allows the formation of organized nanostructures in nanofibers. The polarity of the magnet has been used to manipulate the electric field distribution in the electrospinning system. Based on the configuration of magnetic flux lines, the distribution of the electric field has been found to be altered. An axial magnetic field has been provided by the repulsive mode configuration, which could be the reason for alignment of nanoparticles during electrospinning. Simulation proved that the bending instability of the charged liquid jet can be efficiently controlled by placing the magnets on both sides of the fiber formation path in the electrospinning system. The impact of an axial magnetic field on nanofiber formation and nanoparticle alignment during the MFAES process was further experimentally validated.","5345":"Alginate is a biopolymer that has exceptional gelling properties, which allow easy gel formation under safe and mild conditions. Consequently, it is often used to encapsulate a variety of cargos, such as cells, enzymes, and lipids, and is typically employed as a model to study hydrogel-based encapsulation systems. Since the first use of alginate in the encapsulation field in the 1970s, many methods have been developed to produce alginate hydrogel particles of different sizes, structures, and morphologies.

The fabricated hybrid displayed superior catalytic performance due to the synergetic effects between NiO nanoparticles and CNFs. Excellent analytical features, including high sensitivity (1.55 mu A mM(-1)), short response time (<3 s), low detection limit (12.1 nM) and satisfactory linear dynamic range (20-1020 nM) were achieved. Moreover, this EDA-CNFs-NiO hybrid showed good stability and antifouling property in a 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte toward insulin after successive potential cycling, which is highly required for a promising insulin electrocatalyst.","3779":"Metal oxide nanostructures of TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3\/Fe3O4, Bi2O3, CeO2, ITO, SiO2, MoO2, and WO3 have shown great potential for applications in various fields such as piezoelectric, magnetic, gas sensors, and dye sensitized solar cells due to their unique optical, electronic, conductivity, catalytic and antimicrobial properties. However, recovery and reuse of these nanostructures pose big threats from cost and environmental perspectives. Thus, various substrates have been employed for incorporating or immobilizing them but finding suitable substrate is still a big challenge. Paper, being a natural biopolymer, has been used recently to incorporate\/immobilize various metal oxide nanostructures. The metal oxide nanostructures are normally adhered to the cellulose matrices through weak interactions such as van der Waals force and hence, usually have retention related issues. This was circumvented to a great extent by using suitable linkers, binders, or retention aids for the incorporation\/immobilization of the nanostructures in paper matrices. Although these reagents improve retention, as well as some of the properties, they ultimately add cost to the final product. Additionally, these retention aids and linkers hinder accessibility of active surface sites of metal oxide nanostructures for their various applications. Very recently our group developed an in situ single step hydrothermal method to immobilize metal oxide nanostructures such as TiO2, ZnO, and Bi2O3 without using any binder, linker or retention aid. In this review a comprehensive account of the development of methodology for incorporation\/immobilization of metal oxide nanostructures is discussed. Furthermore, how the immobilization of nanostructures evolved without using any binder, linker or retention aid is thoroughly discussed based on the chemistry of the cellulose and metal oxides. Applications of nanostructure immobilized paper matrices are highlighted and critical challenges are discussed along with directions for future research.","5212":"Recycled cellulose fibers (RCF) from waste paper were utilized to prepare bio-based aerogels through an environmentally friendly freeze-drying method. Food thickening agent sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) served as a matrix in the bio-aerogels. The microstructures and mechanical properties of the aerogels have been studied as a function of RCF\/CMC content. Sodium montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were added to enhance the thermal stability and flame retardancy, which were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry respectively. It was found that the Na+-MMT significantly improved the fire retardancy of the aerogels and APP played a synergistic effect with it. The initial decomposition temperature increased by 15 degrees C and the peak of heat release rate decreased from 90 to 49.5 kW m(-2) in the presence of 33% clay. Addition of APP further increased the residue amount and reduced the fire growth rate. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyse the char formed after cone calorimeter tests.","6468":"A combinatorial nanosystem with the advantages of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO NPs) and targeting polymer carriers is expected to improve the therapeutic effects in developing multifunctional delivery systems. Here we developed an innovative tumor-specific multi-functional SPIO NPs nanoplatform containing the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) and fluorescent dye rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) for theranostic analysis and anti-tumor therapy in human brain tumor U251 MG cells. The core nanocarrier SPIO NPs (gamma-Fe2O3) were synthesized and decorated with chitosan (CS), subsequently followed with conjugation with tumor-specific ligand transferrin (Tf) to fabricate tumor-targeted Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs. The anti-tumor drug DOX was then loaded onto Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs, and transferred into U251 MG cells for assaying their biological effects. Besides, the produced Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs were fluorescently labeled with RBITC for simultaneously intracellular fluorescent\/magnetic resonance imaging in targeted U251 MG cells. The results showed that the fabricated Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs nanocarriers demonstrated some favorable properties, including immediate responses under magnetic fields, stable behavior in different media, efficient encapsulation for drug loading, undetectable cytotoxicity, and effective intracellular visualization. Moreover, the fluorescent Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs could be successfully applied for concurrent fluorescent\/magnetic resonance imaging, and the finalized drug-loading Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs displayed an improved cellular uptake, and thus effectively killed tumor cells through inducing a concurrence of cell apoptosis and autophagy in the treated tumor U251 cells. Therefore, the fabricated Tf-CS\/SPIO NPs should be of great significance in developing multi-purpose nanocarriers for anti-tumor drug delivery and fluorescent\/magnetic resonance imaging in human brain tumor treatments.","6434":"Background: Potable, clean and safe water is the basic need for all human beings. Major portion of the earth is occupied by water, however, this is contaminated by rapid industrialization, improper sewage and natural calamities and man-made activates, which produce several water-borne and fetal diseases. In this review we presented some recent patent for environmental remediation. Methods: Various technologies have been developed for the treatment of waste water consist of chemical, membrane, filtration, sedimentation, chlorination, disinfection, electrodialysis, electrolysis, reverse osmosis and adsorption. Among these entire phenomenon's, adsorption was the most efficient method for wastewater treatment, because it is a quick and cheap technology which signifies extensive practical applications. Adsorption phenomenon has been tactfully used for the removal of biological waste as well as soluble and insoluble material with a removal efficacy of 90-99%. Results: Clean water supply is limited to human beings. The people in the developing countries have less or no access to the clean and potable water. The shortage of potable water resources and long term safe water deficiencies are some of the leading problems worldwide. In this review, we have explained in the detail adsorption phenomena of chitosan, pharmaceutical importance and other applications. It is worth to say that adsorption technologies using chitosan and its derivative is one of the quickest and cost effective methods for the wastewater treatment. The review comprises of ninety eight references. This review also covers various patents vis-a-vis the role of chitosan-nanocomposite in environmental application for wastewater treatment. Conclusion: Chitosan is a pseudo-neutral cationic polymer which is formed by the de-acetylation of chitin polymer. Various patent on chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite were taken into account related to wastewater purification. We have found that chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite are used for the removal of viruses, bacteria, cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts, soluble and insoluble organic pollutants, poly aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals from wastewater. In this study, we also found that chitosan and chitosan-nanocomposite are selected for the removal of transition metals.","5457":"Poly(vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate) (PVA) copolymers obtained by partial hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) are of practical importance for many applications, including emulsion and suspension polymerization processes. Their molecular characteristics have a major influence on the colloidal and interfacial properties. The most significant characteristics are represented by the average degree of hydrolysis (DH) over bar, average degree of polymerization (DPw) over bar but also by the average acetate sequence length n(0)(VAc) which designates the so-called blockiness. Colloidal aggregates were observed in the aqueous PVA solutions having a (DH) over bar value of 73 mol%. The volume fraction of these aggregates at a given (DH) over bar value is directly correlated to the blockiness. Three PVA samples with identical (DH) over bar and (DPw) over bar but different blockiness were examined. By pendant drop and oscillating pendant drop techniques it was shown that the PVA sample having the lowest blockiness and thus the lowest volume fraction of colloidal aggregates has lower interfacial tension and elastic modulus E' values. On the contrary, the corresponding values are highest for PVA sample of higher blockiness. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the colloidal aggregates are disaggregated by complex formation due to the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. The PVA-SDS complex acts as a partial polyelectrolyte that induces the stretching of the chains and thus a reduction of the interface thickness. In this case, the interfacial tension and the elastic modulus both increase with increasing SDS concentration for all three PVA samples and the most significant effect was noticed for the most \"blocky\" copolymer sample.","259":"Solid and nanocomposite polymer electrolytes based on chitosan have been prepared by solution cast technique. The XRD results reveal the occurrence of complexation between chitosan (CS) and the LiTf salt. The deconvolution of the diffractogram of nanocomposite solid polymer electrolytes demonstrates the increase of amorphous domain with increasing alumina content up to 4wt.%. Further incorporation of alumina nanoparticles (6 to 10 wt.% Al2O3) results in crystallinity increase (large crystallite size). The morphological (SEM and EDX) analysis well supported the XRD results. Similar trends of DC conductivity and dielectric constant with Al2O3 concentration were explained. The TEM images were used to explain the phenomena of space charge and blocking effects. The reformulated Arrhenius equation (sigma((epsilon',T)) = sigma(o)exp((-Ea\/KB epsilon'T))) was proposed from the smooth exponential behavior of DC conductivity versus dielectric constant at different temperatures. The more linear behavior of DC conductivity versus 1000\/(epsilon' x T) reveals the crucial role of dielectric constant in Arrhenius equation. The drawbacks of Arrhenius equation can be understood from the less linear behavior of DC conductivity versus 1000\/T The relaxation processes have been interpreted in terms of Argand plots.","6027":"Cr-decorated hexagonal Co3O4 nanosheets were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method on a SiO2\/Si substrate, followed by a simple physical deposition of Cr film and a thermal annealing treatment. The Co3O4 nanosheets possess a porous and polycrystalline structure consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles; Cr2O3 nanoparticles are uniformly formed on the surface of the Co3O4 nanosheets after the annealing treatment. The ethanol-sensing properties of the Cr-decorated hexagonal Co3O4 nanosheets were investigated in detail, and compared to pure hexagonal Co3O4 nanosheets, they show unique sensing properties toward ethanol, including high response (5.4) even when the ethanol concentration is as low as 10 ppm, ultrafast response (1 s) and recovery (7 s) rates, and good selectivity at a 300 degrees C operating temperature. These properties make the Cr-decorated hexagonal Co3O4 nanosheets good candidates for ethanol detection.","3704":"Solution-processed oxide semiconductors have been widely studied with the objective of achieving high-performance, sustainable and low-cost electronic devices. In this report a simple and eco-friendly water-inducement method has been developed to fabricate high-k dielectrics and hybrid thin-film transistors (TFTs); introducing metal nitrates and deionized water as the precursor materials. The AlOx dielectric films annealed at temperatures higher than 350 degrees C result in low leakage current densities and the dielectric constants are nearly 7. Instead of the conventional oxide semiconductors, water-induced (WI) polyvinylprrolidone (PVP) was introduced into the In2O3 solution to form a hybrid metal oxide\/polymer channel layer. The 250 degrees C-annealed WI In2O3 : PVP TFTs based on AlOx dielectric exhibit outstanding electrical performances and high stability. These promising properties were obtained at an ultra-low operating voltage of 2 V. The WI metal oxide\/polymer hybrid TFTs are promising alternatives for applications in low-cost, low-consumption and eco-friendly flexible electronics.","380":"This paper presents the analysis into microwave magnetic properties of magnetic microwires and their composites in the context of applications in wireless sensors and tunable microwave materials. It is demonstrated that the intrinsic permeability of wires has a wide frequency dispersion with relatively large values in the GHz band. In the case of a specific magnetic anisotropy this results in a tunable microwave impedance which could be used for distributed wireless sensing networks in functional composites. The other range of applications is related with developing the artificial magnetic dielectrics with large and tunable permeability. The composites with magnetic wires with a circumferential anisotropy have the effective permeability which differs substantially from unity for a relatively low concentration (less than 10%). This can make it possible to design the wire media with a negative and tunable index of refraction utilising natural magnetic properties of wires. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By combination of doping and structural optimization, semiconductors with wide band gaps could transform into highly active visible light photocatalysts. In this work, C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres hierarchically constructed by self-assembled nanosheets were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method applying glucose as the carbon source for the first time. The incorporation of an external C element into the crystal structure of (BiO)(2)CO3 could narrow the band gap by down-shifting the conduction band, and meantime generate some localized states above the valence band edge. The C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 hierarchical self-assembly exhibited highly enhanced and stable photocatalytic activity for NO removal under visible light illumination, far exceeding those of undoped (BiO)(2)CO3, C-doped TiO2 and N-doped (BiO)(2)CO3. The improved photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the increased visible light absorption, improved charge separation and transfer as well as the special hierarchical structure. The C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres also generated enhanced visible light induced photocurrent density. There exists an optical amount of C element introduced into the crystal structure. In addition, the growth mechanism of C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 hierarchical microspheres has been proposed. By using other carbohydrates like maltose, fructose, sucrose and starch as the carbon doping source, C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 can also be synthesized, which indicates that carbohydrates are a general type of carbon doping source. This work could provide a one-step and general method to fabricate highly active C-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 photocatalysts, which simultaneously provide new insight into the enhancement of visible photocatalysis by combination of carbon doping and structural optimization.","2252":"Design of pressure sensors with ultra-sensitivity, rapid response speed and long-term stability is a key procedure to fulfill high performance electronic skins.

Channel widths were defined by hydrophobic wax, and gold-sputtering through a mask was used to pattern an electrochemical cell at the end of the channel. The physical properties and surface chemistries of various filter papers were studied with respect to the separation of ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA). Both porosity as well as the ion-exchange capacity of the filter papers were found to influence the separation. Under the conditions used, Whatman grade P81 strong cation exchange paper based on cellulose phosphate was found to fully retain DA. Detection of both AA and DA was achieved on the other filter papers, however, different behaviours were observed. Whatman 4 could not resolve AA from DA while VWR 413 could achieve baseline separation under the conditions used. Depending on the level of oxidative treatment that they undergo, cellulose papers can have carboxyl groups present on the fibres that can act as sources of ion-exchange sites, thus making these types of papers potentially useful for ion-exchange separations. The ion-exchange capacities of the filter papers were investigated and quantified. It was shown that the ion-exchange properties of the papers evaluated varied dramatically. Furthermore, eluent ionic strength and pH were optimised to achieve a baseline resolution of AA and DA. The limit of detection of DA was 3.41 mu M when analysed in the presence of 1 mM AA showing the potential of this mu PAD for the detection of catecholamines in biological samples containing high concentrations of AA.","4778":"There are numerous organic pollutants that lead to several types of ecosystem damage and threaten human health. Wastewater treatment plants are responsible for the removal of natural and anthropogenic pollutants from the sewage, and because of this function, they play an important role in the protection of human health and the environment.

In addition, NMR can provide physical information (rigidity, dynamics, etc.) as well as permit in depth quantification. Hyphenation with other techniques such as liquid chromatography, solid phase extraction and mass spectrometry creates unprecedented capabilities for the identification of novel and unknown chemical species.

Photo-triggered decrosslinking is especially advantageous for easy remote activation and spatiotemporal control. However, only a few photolabile units have been used for the cleavage in crosslinkers. Herein, 1,4-diacetylbenzene 1,4-bis(O-methacryloyl) dioxime and 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene 1,3,5-tris(O-methacryloyl)trioxime are proposed as novel crosslinkers. They have a benzene ring bearing two or three arms in which O-acyloxime moiety is introduced as a novel type of photolabile unit. These crosslinkers were prepared from aromatic ketones in two steps. Photopolymerization of methyl acrylate and the crosslinkers was performed using diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide as a photoinitiator and UV light above 310 nm. Obtained polymer films were crosslinked and insoluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF). These films were further irradiated at 254 nm of light. The photolysis of O-acyloxime units in these crosslinkers were confirmed by UV and IR spectral measurements. The precedence of decrosslinking on 254 nm irradiation was evidenced by the decrease in thickness of the films after soaking in THF. Soluble fraction of the decrosslinked polymers were subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and their molecular weights were found to be similar to that obtained by photopolymerized film in the absence of the crosslinker. These results demonstrated that the proposed compounds are potential candidates for novel photolabile crosslinkers.","6246":"Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) aerogels produced by critical-point-drying of wet-gel precursors exhibit unique properties, such as high surface-area-to-volume and strength-to-weight ratios.

The obtained aerogels can be used as efficient catalysts for organic dye degradation, reduction of 4-nitrophenol, and synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane. A set of characterizations, including FESEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman, FTIR, optical absorption, and photoluminescence techniques, confirm that the aerogel is formed from ultra-dispersed AgI nanocrystals and the self-assembly of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets into porous hydrogel structures. The obtained aerogels exhibit high photocatalytic degradation ability toward an organic dye (rhodamine-B) because of the high visible light-driven catalytic activity of AgI and the high specific surface area of graphene nanosheets with three-dimensional interconnected pores. The well-wrapped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets on AgI nanostructures could promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons, which not only effectively inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes but also suppresses the photocorrosion of AgI; this promotes the photocatalytic activity and stability. Moreover, these nanostructures show the best catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4 as a reducing agent. Furthermore, the AgI-reduced graphene oxide aerogel nanocomposites are active catalysts for the synthesis of bis(indolyl) methane under solvent-free conditions.

The synergy of these technologies with catalysis, their impact on the cellulose structure and reactivity are discussed. Particularly, we highlight that these non-thermal technologies not only induce a fast cleavage of the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond of cellulose but also promote random re-polymerization reactions yielding glucans with different types of glycosidic linkages (alpha\/beta-1,4, -1,3, -1,6, -1,2) and degrees of polymerization. Remarkably, these technologies are capable of converting cellulose to soluble glucans at low temperature (<70 degrees C), a pivotal aspect with respect to sugar stability and purity. Furthermore, the absence of solvent (and catalyst in some cases) greatly facilitates the isolation of glucans. Thanks to the presence of different types of glycosidic linkages, these glucans are much more prone to functionalization or catalytic conversion than cellulose, thus paving the way for the production of macromolecules that have a great market potential. The electricity requirement is one of the main cost drivers for the implementation of these technologies. Based on the market price of a few products, we wish to discuss the application domains of these technologies in terms of the business capabilities it may support. Mechanocatalysis, non-thermal atmospheric plasma and sonochemistry were selected as the main examples for the discussion.","6216":"Exploring low-cost and high-performance nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal-air batteries is crucial for the commercialization of these energy conversion and storage devices.

The electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity (onset potential of -0.02V and half-wave potential of -0.140V) closely comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt\/C catalyst in alkaline media, and good ORR activity in acidic media, which is among the highest reported activities of NPMCs.","5902":"In order to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of oxide semiconductors, variant processes have been proposed. The creation of the heterojunction composites has attracted considerable attentions and developed into an important research area for the high performance photocatalyst preparation. In this paper, we introduce the research progress on heterojunction composites which were prepared via a novel physical route with relatively high temperature treatments. It is hope that this mini-review can inspire research interest in the realm of heterojunction synthesis based on the thermal diffusion mechanism.","7412":"In this report, star-shaped silver@gold (Ag@Au) nanoparticles were synthesized in collagen (Coll) suspensions by a seeding growth approach. The silver nanoparticles were used as seeds for Au development. Coll was used as a protecting agent and the effect of its concentration on stability was also examined. Obtained nanoparticles were then characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, XRD and FTIR. The result was confirmed by the maximum surface plasmon resonance peak at 566-580 nm for each sample indicating the formation of branched Ag@Au@Coll NPs. The average diameters of the branched Ag@Au@Coll NPs were revealed to be 30-50 nm depending on the corresponding component ratios and the pH values. It is interesting to note that the concentration of Coll plays a critical role in the stability of the star-shaped gold nanoparticles. The results offer an understanding of the handling of the electronic and the silver@gold based nanoparticles stability properties.","5164":"The pH and Ca2+ oscillations of KBrO3-Na2SO3-K4Fe(CN)(6) (BSF) system in presence of EDTA or Ca-EDTA were investigated. Both EDTA and Ca-EDTA can depress the amplitude and period of pH oscillation, and the effects of Ca-EDTA are more obvious. These effects are attributed to the buffer effect in pH change. The Ca2+ oscillation appears as Ca-EDTA introduced into the BSF system, which is ascribed to the stability of Ca-EDTA being pH-dependent. The pH and pCa (pCa = -log[Ca2+]) oscillations are synchronous in case of higher concentration of Ca-EDTA; however, the chaotic behavior emerged in pCa oscillation arises at lower pH as the concentration of Ca-EDTA is lower. Such observations can be understood by taking into account the interference of H+ on the response of Ca-ISE to Ca2+. Both amplitude and period for pH and pCa oscillations as KCl introduced into the system can be obviously shortened due to the effect of ion strength on the reaction rate of the core oscillator and on the conditional formation constant of Ca-EDTA. The results are significant for determining whether an experimentally observed chaos in chemical systems is of deterministic origin or is due to experimental noise.","2758":"Ganciclovir (GCV) is a nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity against herpes viral infections, and the most widely used antiviral to treat cytomegalovirus infections. However, the low bioavailability and short half-life of GCV necessitate the development of a carrier for sustained delivery. In this study, guanosine-based GCV was used as the initiator directly in ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) to form hydrophobic GCV-poly(caprolactone) (GCV-PCL) which was then grafted with hydrophilic chitosan to form amphiphilic copolymers for the preparation of stable micellar nanoparticles. Successful synthesis of GCV-PCL and GCV-PCL-chitosan were verified by H-1-NMR analysis. Self-assembled micellar nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering and zetasizer with an average size of 117 nm and a positive charge of 24.2 mV. The drug release kinetics of GCV was investigated and cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that GCV-tagged polymeric micelles were non-toxic. Our results showed that GCV could be used directly in the initiation of ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-CL and non-toxic polymeric micelles for GCV delivery can be formed.","4586":"Colloidal stability and antimicrobial activity are important parameters for silver antibacterial agents, which are utilized in a broad range of biomedical applications. In this study, the preparation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized silver nanoparticles (PEI-AgNPs) with various levels of silver was realized, and the molecular mechanism of synergistic antibacterial activity of PEI on AgNPs was investigated. High-yielding uniform sized AgNPs were found to be obtained by reducing the molar ratios of PEI (less than one tenth of Ag+) and NaBH4 and keeping the reaction at around 45 degrees C. However, an excess of AgNPs was found to cause discoloration of the light colored fabrics, and ultimately affected the applicable performance of light colored antibacterial fabrics. In order to simultaneously maintain the synergistic antimicrobial effect of PEI on AgNPs and resist the discoloration of PEI-AgNPs, the molar ratio of Ag+ to PEI was investigated to be less than 2:1. When the molar ratio of Ag+ to PEI was 1:2 with the Ag+ concentration at 50 ppm, appropriate PEI-AgNPs were obtained with excellent antibacterial effect and no fabric discoloration. The inhibition zones of PEI-AgNPs against S. Aureus ATCC6038 and E. coli 8099 reached 4 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively.","6818":"Functional multi-responsive drug delivery vehicles have drawn considerable attention owing to their merits of low toxicity and improved antitumor efficiency. In this article, novel Fe3O4@chitosan@phytic acid (FCP) magnetic pH-sensitive nanoscaled microspheres with narrow size distribution and high drug loading efficiency for doxorubicin (DOX) of up to 94.2% have been successfully prepared in a facile one-step hydrothermal method utilized in controlled drug releasing and combination therapy. The constructed nanocarriers exhibited high saturation of 24.83 emu g(-1), excellent pH-response in weak acidic regions like tumor tissues while drug releasing and obvious anticancer efficiency, which was verified by MTT test in the MG-63 cancer cell line in vitro, leading to notable inhibition of tumor growth without negative consequences. Therefore, the as-prepared FCP nanoparticles show promising potential as drug carriers to improve antitumor therapeutic efficacy.","3742":"Polarization of atoms plays a substantial role in molecular interactions. Class I and II force fields mostly calculate with fixed atomic charges which can cause inadequate descriptions for highly charged molecules, for example, ion channels or metalloproteins. Changes in charge distributions can be included into molecular mechanics calculations by various methods. Here, we present a very fast computational quantum mechanical method, the Bond Polarization Theory (BPT). Atomic charges are obtained via a charge calculation method that depend on the 3D structure of the system in a similar way as atomic charges of ab initio calculations. Different methods of population analysis and charge calculation methods and their dependence on the basis set were investigated. A refined parameterization yielded excellent correlation of R = 0.9967. The method was implemented in the force field COSMOS-NMR and applied to the histidine-tryptophan-complex of the transmembrane domain of the chi(2) protein channel of influenza A virus. Our calculations show thatmoderate changes of side chain torsion angle chi(1) and small variations of.. 2 of Trp-41 are necessary to switch from the inactivated into the activated state; and a rough two-side jump model of His-37 is supported for proton gating in accordance with a flipping mechanism."},"label":{"6416":"Chemistry","5432":"Material Science","6575":"Material Science","5850":"Material
